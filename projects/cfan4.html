        <h1>CFAN4</h1>
        <hr>

        <p><i>(also check out <a href="/projects/cfan6.html">CFAN6</a>, the second part)</i></p>

        <p>CFAN4 (Camp For Absolutely Nothing 4) is an animated series i worked on for a bit as part of one of those "object show camp" type things. there's an explanation of what those are on <a href="/projects/cfan6.html">CFAN6</a>'s page</p>

        <p>the entires involve jay and elle (although i was the one that signed up as jay, a friend signed up as elle but we both worked together), doing challenges given by blursed table, a table where their legs are the proper object show legs, and blursed chair as the sidekick, often the one in troubling scenarios</p>

        <p>note that all characters are based off of actual people's OCs as they were submitted into the camp. most entries besides mine and someone else's were done privately in the discord, so that's why you can't see many other results unlike stuff such as CDM4</p>

        <p>production wise i stopped working it after one of the challenges because i was starting to make these entries way too long for the effort i usually put into them (which usually took me a day, now took like a whole week lmao)</p>

        <p>by the way CFAN6 skips a number after 4 because i wasn't there for season 5</p>
