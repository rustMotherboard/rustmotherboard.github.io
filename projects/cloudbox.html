        <p>have you ever used the toybox feature in garry's mod? before the steam release of <abbr
                title="garry's mod">gmod</abbr> - and before the workshop, there was the toybox! a tab in the spawn menu
            that loaded up a site that'd let you load up any entity or prop or map and it'd download it live from the
            server so it could spawn into the world. ever since <abbr title="garry's mod">gmod</abbr> 13 and valve's
            introduction of the workshop, downloading stuff live in the midst of a game just wasn't really done the same
            anymore... now it's all tied to the workshop</p>

        <p>now with that all in mind, what if i told you there's a new recreation of the system in development that lets
            this system work in the latest versions of <abbr title="garry's mod">gmod</abbr>? here's cloudbox! an open
            source reimplementation of the toybox system for modern versions of <abbr title="garry's mod">gmod</abbr>
            (alongside older versions!)</p>

        <p>this service also serves as an archive for the toybox content that was considered lost to time - but now with
            the ability to submit new ones! this is because this works just like the old toybox, meaning new content can
            always be added by the userbase! the way these were preserved is already described in the desciption of
            cloudbox on the workshop, so i'll just provide that</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Versions of Garry's Mod that came with Toybox used to locally save (almost) everything you downloaded.
                We've taken those cached files and converted them into a new format so they can be downloaded and used
                again.</p>

        <p>my contributions to the cloudbox project is mainly all of the icons and most of the interface designs. these
            icons are all designed in adobe animate and are meant to be more modern versions of the original toybox
            icons</p>

        <p>the way the outlines are all done on these are automated using a glow effect with a super high strength so the glow becomes a solid color. for the most part this works! it's just the umbrella being the one example of it not working very well <span style="font-size: smaller;">(see the points on the umbrella part itself)</span></p>
