            <h3 id="october-12th-2019-suzuran-12-00-am">October 12th, 2019 / Suzuran / 12:00 AM</h3>
            <p>The sun looms over a building in a moderately large city, clouds blocking some of the rays of light into the nearest walls of tan and grey buildings, also generating shadows for where the light doesn’t reach as well. The grass around the building, otherwise referred to as the yards, have a nice lush green color to it, even if most of the way to the entrance is paved with industrial road. The grass and shrubs are regularly tended to, whether by one of the building’s members, or a passing citizen doing community service, be it willingly or forcefully.</p>
            <p>This is the city of Suzuran, and this building is their school. To some, it may just be their second home. It’s interior is nothing too special, maybe a handful of posters, but it’s all well put together, even if nothing fancy.</p>
            <p>As of the current time, it’s break between one class and the other, specifically a Physics course and Geology as the upcoming one. A few people are out and about in the hallways, checking their schedules, maybe checking themselves out in the mirror, perhaps the occasional gander at a bulletin board.</p>
            <h3 id="homeroom">Homeroom</h3>
            <p>One room in particular though, the homeroom, has a few people doing their own thing. Their next and previous class have been here anyways, so it wouldn’t make sense to go to another classroom. Since it’s homeroom, it’s a tad more messy and personal. A few stray objects, a whiteboard with some fun drawings and scribbles, some drawers for storage. It gets their work done.</p>
            <p>&quot;So...what’s new with you two?&quot; says a red haired girl, sitting in a computer desk, twirling a red and yellow mechanical pencil in her hand. Her hairstyle has twin drills, and a green hair clip to the side. A red tuft of hair on the top, and wearing a school-provided blazer with a grey accent color and a red skirt to match.</p>
            <p>Her name is Ringo, part of the Andou family. She’s talking to a rather eager beanie-wearing blonde and a brown haired gal with a ponytail.</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, it’s been great!! I’ve finally caught up with last week’s assignment!&quot; exclaims the blonde. Her name’s Amitie, she’s surely one to talk. Her body language is exaggerated, moving her arms energetically, given her extrovert nature.</p>
            <p>&quot;I mean what you’re doing <em>on your own time</em>, Amitie.&quot; Ringo replies, chuckling at the end.</p>
            <p>&quot;o-<em>Oh!</em> That’s what you meant?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;That’s also been going just great!&quot; She can’t help but giggle in her uplifting mood. &quot;I’ve been scrap-booking some more neat goings-on during my walks around the district!&quot; She stretches her arms back.</p>
            <p>// earlier dialogue involved yoga poses. decided scrap-booking would be better</p>
            <p>// note that this au thing doesn’t have magic...rather this will be replaced by nano-tech later</p>
            <p>&quot;Hey! Mind your arms!&quot; The brown-hair buts in. &quot;You almost knocked over the house of cards!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Ah, sorry Arle!&quot; stutters Amitie.</p>
            <p>&quot;Right, Arle.&quot; asks Ringo. &quot;How’s it been with you?&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle shrugs it off, albeit carefully staring at her pyramid of cards. &quot;Eh. Could be better. I’m fine with the current load of work, but I’m getting all irritable about it.&quot;.</p>
            <p>The stack of cards is relatively mediocre compared to other ones Ringo and Amitie have witnessed over the last few months. Some get as high as about half a meter. Folks gossip about the ultra rare ‘1 meter stacks’.</p>
            <p>&quot;Maybe that’s why you’re not performing as well.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;You think so?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;It only makes sense.&quot; she replies back with, spinning in the computer desk’s chair rather slowly, pushing the chair with her right leg, the left one following. She portrays a rather unintentionally smug pose, with her eyes closed and a shrug to boot.</p>
            <p>&quot;Mph.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie starts staring at the stack of cards, fascinated by how Arle’s been able to do that to kill a few minutes in-between breaks of classes. As she watches Arle carefully stack cards on top of one another, she turns to Ringo, who’s still turning around in the computer desk chair.</p>
            <p>&quot;What about you, Ringo?&quot;</p>
            <p>The drill-haired stops her spinning to look towards Amitie. &quot;Me?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Yeah, silly! What’s on your mind?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Hm.&quot; She ponders for a moment. &quot;I can’t think of much. The most I’ve done today was work on that assigned project. Besides that, I sorta just hang around with you guys.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Hah! That’s sweet of you!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Aha...<em>yeah.</em>&quot; she replies back with, unsure on how to feel about it. &quot;...But still. That’s all. You’ve been into scrap-booking and Arle’s been working on steadying her arms.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Well, it doesn’t hurt to take a break every now and again.&quot; Arle adds in to the conversation, steadily focusing on the cards, not exactly looking at Ringo.</p>
            <p>&quot;Yeah!&quot; says Amitie. &quot;You’re free to hang around with us after classes today. I’ll be off on my walk, then I’m off to the shopping district!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Don’t you have your usual night at that goth’s house?&quot; remarks Arle.</p>
            <p>// referring to Feli, Amitie later goes here to learn about horoscopes.</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! Right, that as well! I learn a lot of new mysterious stuff from Feli that we don’t get to know about here, such as how long it takes for a...&quot;</p>
            <p>As Amitie goes on about her plans for the evening, Ringo starts to blindly stare into nothing, the conversation between Arle and Amitie fading out to her, not sure what to really respond with. Her expression shows uncertainty.</p>
            <p>&quot;...Um.&quot;</p>
            <p>She quickly snaps herself out of it and turns around to look back at the CRT monitor. It’s displaying her own schoolwork, as the school provides its own service to work on assignments. Despite the time she’s spent on the latest assignment, having been working on a study document for physics (her favorite subject, so to speak), it’s nearing the due date of the 17th, a Saturday. She’s only gotten halfway through with it.</p>
            <p>The sound of a CRT whirring, displaying a convoluted physics document, muffle out the conversation between Arle and Amitie. She wants the document done before the deadline...but how does she-</p>
            <p>&quot;Ringo?&quot;</p>
            <p>-? Someone’s calling her name.</p>
            <p>&quot;Ringo!&quot;</p>
            <p>She quickly jolts back to the two in a panic.</p>
            <p>&quot;Huh??&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;We’ve tried calling your name out a few times now, Ringo. What’s with you?&quot; pointed out Arle.</p>
            <p>Ringo darts her eyes to the left, where the CRT is, and back to Arle and Ringo, giving them concerned looks, as she gives one back.</p>
            <p>&quot;u-Um. I’m doing fine. It’s just I’m focused on working on the assignment from last week. It <em>is</em> about something I’ve enjoyed for as long as I remember.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;But you don’t seem happy about it!&quot; exclaims Amitie, the wind coming off of her arms moving actually knock over the triangle of cards.</p>
            <p>Arle reacts with an appropriate &quot;Hey!!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! My bad!!&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle sighs. &quot;It’s...fine, don’t worry about it.&quot;</p>
            <p>Ringo keeps the conversation on track before the two start continuing their topic on card stacking.</p>
            <p>&quot;I know, I know. It’s just I...prefer to spend a good chunk of time with it. If it’s an assignment on something that I excel in, I’d rather put the most effort I can out of it.&quot;</p>
            <p>She tries her best to keep her chin up. The other two look at each other and back to Ringo.</p>
            <p>Amitie says &quot;That’s fair!&quot; while Arle says &quot;Suit yourself.&quot; considering she plans on following around with Amitie’s time around the shopping district later. Ringo’s concern doesn’t fluctuate by any means. She knows the two obviously cares for her, but still.</p>
            <p><strong>RING!</strong></p>
            <p>The bell rings, it must be 1 PM already.</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; Amitie points out. &quot;The bell. Next subject should start any moment!&quot;</p>
            <p>Ringo sighs to herself, turning back to the CRT. She presses CTRL + S and turns the machine off. She’ll get to it when she goes home. A ‘future me’ problem, as one may put it.</p>
            <p>&quot;What do we have next?&quot; asks Ringo.</p>
            <p>&quot;Geology.&quot; answers Arle, with a bit of an already bored tone to it.</p>
            <p>&quot;Ah, I don’t mind it.&quot; cheerfully mentions Amitie. There isn’t really a class that she ‘dislikes’, it’s more of how well she actually performs with it.</p>
            <p>&quot;Alright then.&quot; starts Ringo. &quot;I’ll get the books out.&quot;</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 id="hallway-3-00-pm">Hallway / 3:00 PM</h3>
            <p><strong>RING!</strong></p>
            <p>Another two subjects pass, and the bell rings once more for the day. The hallways are filled with people moving about, either preparing to go home or staying for another hour.</p>
            <p>&quot;Well...that was a day!&quot; remarked Amitie, keeping her charm up.</p>
            <p>&quot;You’re one to say.&quot; replies Arle, arms over her shoulders. &quot;Could barely keep my eyes open.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie giggles, remarking, &quot;Oh, Arle! You know better than to sleep during a lesson! Even if it <em>is</em> geology.&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle can&#39;t help but laugh back. Amitie’s seemingly extrovert mood can be contagious.</p>
            <p>&quot;Aha...yeah. Thanks for keeping an eye out.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;It’s what I try to do!&quot;</p>
            <p>As the two confront their lockers and start packing, a thought runs through Arle’s head as she gets out her outdoor attire. It’s been this way for about a few days.</p>
            <p>&quot;Something’s off.&quot; she says under her breath. Amitie catches on the hesitation.</p>
            <p>&quot;Arle?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;what-Huh? What?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;You kind of...hesitated for a moment. Is everything alright?&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle continues while putting her coat on.</p>
            <p>&quot;No, it’s...it’s fine.&quot;</p>
            <p>A brief moment of silence occurs between the two.</p>
            <p>&quot;Is it about Ringo again?&quot;</p>
            <p>She pauses, eyes locked towards Amitie’s sight.</p>
            <p>&quot;...Pretty much.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie answers back with a modest &quot;Ah.&quot;, as it’s been a repeating occurrence. &quot;Yeah, that’s fair. I’ve been worried about her too. She spends a lot of time with that project.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;What makes it all the weirder though is how it’s usually one of her favorite subjects.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Maybe she’s overworking herself? That project’s due in, like, five days.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Should we...talk to her about it?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I think she’s still in the homeroom, actually. You’ll have to confront her about it though, if I stay here any longer I’ll run late for the plans I got. You’ll have to catch up-&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle immediately gets the point, and insists &quot;I know, I know. I’ll catch up with you at the district soon enough. I’ll shoot a text over when I’m there.&quot;</p>
            <p>With her coat still on, she starts walking back to the homeroom to confront Ringo about the project. Amitie, having fully gotten herself into the outdoor attire, suddenly halts Arle.</p>
            <p>&quot;Actually, Arle, wait!&quot;</p>
            <p>She stops mid-step. &quot;?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I should probably...mention this now, but don’t go forcefully hard on her about this, alright?&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle tilts her head, a bit bewildered. &quot;I mean...I’ll try not to?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;She spends a lot of time with the project, I’m not exactly sure what she’ll do if you flat out tell her to...stop.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;...Oh. Well. Still, I’ll try not to.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Alright then, I’m off! Text me when you’re at the district!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Mph.&quot; She simply nods, as the two part ways.</p>
            <h3 id="homeroom-3-05-pm">Homeroom / 3:05 PM</h3>
            <p>The computer desk appears to still be occupied by Ringo, a few physics book to the right of the mouse, and some stray draft papers to the left of the keyboard, weighed down by a pencil and eraser.</p>
            <p>Ringo&#39;s currently working with the assignment for the extra hour she has before she actually <em>has</em> to leave the building. Rather fast at that, too. Each stroke on the keyboard has a good amount of pressure to the key where you could hear it from across the room.</p>
            <p>Her expression is that of nervousness and determination, both due to stress and wanting to finish something she&#39;s spent this much effort on already for the last week.</p>
            <p>Through the window, Arle peeks through the window, spotting Ringo over on the left, only barely being obstructed by the frames of the door. Just as she thought, there&#39;s Ringo, putting all of her time and effort into a <em>damned document</em>. Unsurprisingly, this bothers Arle.</p>
            <p>She knows what to do, however. Much like she said a few minutes earlier with Amitie, just talk to her about it. Simple! She shouldn&#39;t mind, right?</p>
            <p>The door slowly opens, some force applied so that it doesn&#39;t make an obnoxious creaking sound, as the doors are rather worn after years of use. They still serve their function, however.</p>
            <p>As she silently stepped over to the desk, Arle took the time to take in the stuff Ringo has laid around on the desk, books and notes, more than that&#39;s needed at all for something like this. Especially in her eyes, considering the existence of &#39;searching it online&#39;.</p>
            <p>In a way, she&#39;s also kind of impressed with the amount of work Ringo&#39;s putting into this. In the event she does get it done in time, it&#39;d definitely get the extra credit. That&#39;s besides the point, though.</p>
            <p>Ringo hasn&#39;t noticed that someone&#39;s entered the room at all, rather preferring to keep her attention to the work at hand.</p>
            <p>Arle continues to walk towards Ringo until she&#39;s just about a meter away from her, bewildered that she hasn&#39;t been spotted. She gets close enough to where the shadow of her standing starts to loom over Ringo&#39;s workstation.</p>
            <p>Ringo notices the new shadow covering her draft papers, and finally notices Arle looking right over her shoulder. She jumps out of her chair with a shriek, nearly stumbling. The knee-jerk reaction gives Arle a jolt too.</p>
            <p>&quot;PI!&quot; she yelps out, using a math term rather than something such as &#39;CHRIST!&#39;. &quot;H-How long have you just been watching over me for?!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;...About a minute or two.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Alright, alright, Arle...um. Aren&#39;t you...supposed to be with <em>Amitie</em>? Why&#39;re you back here? Did you forget something?&quot; Ringo replies, lining up her draft papers to give her hands something to do, now that she&#39;s up from her seat.</p>
            <p>&quot;That&#39;s not why I&#39;m here.&quot;</p>
            <p>Ringo looks at Arle in confusion. &quot;So <em>why&#39;re</em> you here <em>now</em> then?&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle struggles to come up with a sentence on the spot, so she gives it a few seconds to put something together.</p>
            <p>&quot;It&#39;s about you, Ringo.&quot;</p>
            <p>Ringo&#39;s confusion becomes concern. &quot;...<em>What?</em>&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Erm.. It&#39;s about the...project you&#39;ve been working on since last week.&quot;</p>
            <p>Ringo&#39;s only response is the raise of an eyebrow. Nothing ill-fated, rather not sure what Arle&#39;s going on about.</p>
            <p>In a quick attempt to put words together like patchwork, Arle does her best not to come off as rude about it, to respect what Amitie suggested to her before she left.</p>
            <p>&quot;n-Not that there&#39;s anything wrong <em>in of itself</em> for working on something, it&#39;s just you&#39;ve spent... <em>all your time</em> on it? I haven&#39;t seen you most of the time since.&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle&#39;s response gives Ringo a bit of a poor feeling. She already knew she hadn&#39;t been talking to her and Amitie as of when she started seriously working on the document, but not once had she considered it to concern them. Now that she&#39;s thinking about it, she&#39;s not sure why she never considered it in the first place. As a conclusion, she gives herself some time to think of what to reply back with.</p>
            <p>&quot;I appreciate the concern Arle, believe me, I <em>really</em> do, but I&#39;m sure the both of you know by now that physics has always been a specialty of mine. I <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> want that to go to waste if this document&#39;s practically only about it.&quot;</p>
            <p>To Arle, this practically only means &#39;mind your own damn business&#39;. She knows Ringo well enough that she extends her sentences out often to not come off as rude, but comes off as she&#39;s just saying it that way to sound more credible. Can&#39;t blame her, though.</p>
            <p>Arle starts casually talking about it, thinking less about it past what message she&#39;s trying to send over.</p>
            <p>&quot;Ringo, if you really think working nonstop over a document for a week, and another 5 days after this is going to benefit you, like, if it&#39;s <em>really</em> going to benefit you, at least take some time to rest. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you start taking all-nighters on this. Hell, I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve been doing that already.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;...Actually, I still get sleep, 2 AM to 8:10 AM, I take the first 40 minutes getting myself prepared.&quot; Her responses are quick, yet blunt, Arle&#39;s assuming that she&#39;s trying to speed the conversation up so she can get back to work.</p>
            <p>&quot;That&#39;s...still a pretty bad sleep schedule, Ringo. 6 hours of sleep won&#39;t do <em>anything</em>.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Look, you don&#39;t see me falling asleep in class, do you?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Not downright...but...You&#39;ve definitely almost done that. Only a few days ago have I had to snap my fingers in front of you so that you&#39;d stay awake for at least another drew minutes till the end of a class.&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle&#39;s hoping that adding stuff that&#39;s happened the past week with Ringo will eventually get her to realise her problems and take a breather. She&#39;s really had to try and snap Ringo out if it a few days ago, a close call as well.</p>
            <p>Ringo puts her arms on the desk, leaning herself down a bit.</p>
            <p>&quot;Yeah, well, <em>&#39;almost&#39;</em> still means <em>&#39;none&#39;</em> if you round to the lowest tenth.&quot;</p>
            <p>&#39;This is starting to get ridiculous&#39;, Arle thinks to herself.</p>
            <p>&quot;It <em>doesn&#39;t matter</em> if rounds to none! The fact you were <em>almost</em> sleeping means that the sleep schedule&#39;s been screwing you over, and <em>that&#39;s</em> because of the document!&quot;</p>
            <p>Both sides get increasingly tense in their arguments.</p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;m doing just <em>fine</em>, Arle. You don&#39;t need to worry about it, I&#39;ll get this done by Saturday.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;That&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about <em>at all!</em>&quot;</p>
            <p>Ringo finally starts to get noticeably peeved off at Arle&#39;s attempts.</p>
            <p>&quot;So <em>WHAT</em> are you getting at??&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle can feel something&#39;s probably about to happen, but she keeps persisting her main argument.</p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;m just saying you need to take some damn time off!&quot;</p>
            <p>Ringo pushes herself.</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>I&#39;LL TAKE SOME &#39;DAMN TIME OFF&#39; WHEN I NEED TO!</em>&quot; exclaims Ringo, her fast approach causes the papers and keyboard to fall off the desk, making a loud clattering sound with some papers slowly descending towards the ground.</p>
            <p>The air quickly becomes tense, just as much as their argument&#39;s tension. Arle steps back, trying not to have Ringo seemingly run into her. Ringo&#39;s breathing had doubled in speed, being more audible as a result.</p>
            <p>Arle doesn&#39;t know what to reply with at this point, now having Ringo lash out like this. Anything Arle tries to say only comes off as mere stumbles, nothing coherent.</p>
            <p>&quot;...Ringo-&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;m doing just fine the way I&#39;m handling this, I don&#39;t need your damn input on this. When I get this done, you can stop worrying about me constantly, alright?! You&#39;ve been wasting both <em>your</em>, and <em>my</em> time, so how about <em>YOU</em> give me a <em>DAMN BREAK</em>, and let me work <em>IN PEACE</em>.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;--...&quot;</p>
            <p>She simply doesn&#39;t say anything back. Ringo&#39;s clearly had enough of her for the day, having disrupted her work. She&#39;s about as tough as a stubborn nail. Without saying a word, she slowly starts walking back out of the homeroom, preparing to leave.</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>I hope you know what you&#39;re getting yourself into.</em>&quot; she thinks to herself. She would&#39;ve said it out loud, but would&#39;ve thought Ringo would resort to pelting the books at her so she&#39;d scurry off. She closes the door with more force than usual, making a rather loud thud.</p>
            <p>Ringo, steamed, gets the keyboard and papers off of the floor, reorganizing her notes. She looks at the clock as she sits herself back down on the chair.</p>
            <p>3:20 PM. Arle has probably left by now to meet up with Amitie.</p>
            <p>A wave of immediate regret hits Ringo.</p>

            <h3 id="shopping-district-3-20-pm">Shopping District / 3:20 PM</h3>
            <p>&quot;<em>What could be taking her so long?</em>&quot; Amitie thinks to herself, checking her phone before stuffing it back in her coat. It&#39;s almost been half an hour since she let Arle go talk to Ringo back at the school. Her plans were to check out what was at the district, and then go meet Feli somewhere in the forest. In the meantime, she sits on the closest bench.</p>
            <p>Despite this, she still decides to wait for Arle...maybe the two are having a conversation on the matter. She takes this time to really look around the district from where she sits.</p>
            <p>The Suzuran shopping district could be considered by one to be where the heart of the town lies, with a large, iconic entrance gate with it&#39;s accent green color. While laid out as a regular street, the sides are filled to the brim with stores, majorly community-ran family businesses. Vendors can also be spotted in between.</p>
            <p>Some street signs can be found at the crossroads, as the district is rather close to the school. Any nearby shrubs or trees lack their leaves, due to the season. Any remaining leaves are in a shade of orange to a dark brown.</p>
            <p>Most buildings here are two stories tall, but some can get up to 4 floors, however not many buildings have a reason to be more than 2 floors tall. The top of them occasionally have a billboard for advertising, but it&#39;s not dominant.</p>
            <p>Due to the time, it&#39;s also starting to get dark out as the sun starts to go below the horizon. The daylight dies out faster at this time of the year, so the streetlights are lit up. The sky has a nice, faded gradient from purple to orange, although the sky is mostly filled with purple.</p>
            <p>Amitie has never really took the time to take in these sights for a while now. It&#39;s actually pretty calming, seeing this usually peaceful market at this time of day.</p>
            <p>Before she knew it, she felt a buzz from her coat&#39;s pocket. Upon checking, it&#39;s a message from Arle.</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>comin to the district now, meet u at the crossroad</em>&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>Oh thank goodness,</em>&quot; she says to herself. Arle got through with talking to Ringo. She replies back with a basic &quot;<em>see you there!</em>&quot; which should be more than enough.</p>
            <p>She swings her legs over the bench that she&#39;s sitting on, excited to start hanging out with Arle for the day at the shopping district. There&#39;s been some eye-catching Halloween stuff to celebrate the holiday, and some outfits look like they&#39;d definitely be in her taste.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 id="suzuran-high-school-3-30-pm">Suzuran High School / 3:30 PM</h3>
            <p>&quot;<em>Damn it,</em>&quot; she thinks to herself. &quot;<em>Damn it!</em>&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle isn&#39;t taking the argument she just had with Ringo well. She&#39;s only amplified the worries she had to begin with, which is probably the worst way it could have gone. Worst of all, she doesn&#39;t know how to break it to Amitie. What&#39;s she supposed to say? <em>&#39;Oh, yeah, she got pissed about it?&#39;</em> That won&#39;t do any good.</p>
            <p>As she quickly makes it out of the building, doing her best not to delay the ride to the district any further by any potential questions any stand-byers have to say, she gets to the rack at the side of the entrance. The guidelines state that <em>all</em> parked transportation methods (that aren&#39;t just flat out cars) are to be at the rack, or at best, near it.</p>
            <p>A few bikes, a skateboard even, are at the rack. Due to their mostly similar shape outside of color, it could be hard to tell which is which at this time of day. It&#39;s already getting dark.</p>
            <p>She checks the rack one by one.. bike... bike... skateboard... bike... <em>aha!</em> Here it is.</p>
            <p>Motorcycle.</p>
            <p>It looks out of place next to everything else on the rack, but it pretty much does the same thing, and conveniently is able to stick onto the rack without tipping itself over. Plus, if positioned well, two people could be on the motorcycle at a time, which comes in handy, especially with today&#39;s trip.</p>
            <p>Taking the ignition keys out of her coat pocket, she gets the motorcycle out of the rack and hops on, igniting the engine with a turn of the key. After putting on the helmet hung around the handle of the motorcycle, and a three point turnaround later, she drives off onto the side of the road, quickly making her way to the district.</p>
            <p>The engine can be heard sputtering a bit from the cold, but it eventually warms itself into a workable manner. Some people even hear the engine in the classrooms...although they know at this point it&#39;s just Arle riding off.</p>
            <p>// note, &#39;some&#39;. have Ringo notice it to snap her out of working, or instead have Ringo realize it&#39;s 4 PM, and having her walk back home, then continue her current plot from there</p>
            <h3 id="shopping-district-3-30-pm">Shopping District / 3:30 PM</h3>
            <p>Arle drives to the district, finally. She sees the trademark green gate, and spots Amitie on a nearby bench. Amitie, on the other hand, hears Arle&#39;s motorcycle, and waves eagerly.</p>
            <p>&quot;Arle!! Hi!!&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle parks the motorcycle nearest to the bench and turns off the engine, putting the keys back in her coat. She waves back to Amitie, although not as eager.</p>
            <p>&quot;Hey.&quot; She says, taking off her helmet and putting it on the handles of the motorcycle. &quot;Sorry for taking a bit longer than usual.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>Ah</em>, it&#39;s fine. Don&#39;t worry about it!&quot; Amitie replies with, merely brushing it off, presumably for after they go around the district. That&#39;s what Arle thinks, at least. Regardless, she puts on a faint smile, well aware on what she has to break to Amitie after this. The thought looms over her. For now though, the two decide to keep things loose.</p>
            <p>&quot;...a-Alright, great.&quot; She stretches back a bit. &quot;What&#39;d you want to do here first? Anything catching your eye?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Hm. There&#39;s been new Halloween stuff around. I wanted to take a look at them!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Huh.&quot; Arle looks around. Posters and orange and black colors are strewn about the buildings in preparation for the occasion. &quot;Explains the colors, then. Still, where do we go first?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Hmm.&quot; She takes a quick gander at her surroundings once. Out of all of them, a café twinkles in her view. It has a fancy decorative style around the borders of the entrance&#39;s windows with orange and black stripes, and two outside tables to boot. &quot;How about the café over there?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Sure, don&#39;t see why not.&quot; Arle replies back with.</p>
            <p>&quot;Well then.&quot; Amitie says, jumping out of the bench and landing on the sidewalk next to Arle. &quot;Off we go!&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle silently obliges, as the two walk off to their destination. She still can&#39;t help but feel guilt with how she hasn&#39;t told Amitie about how the conversation with Ringo went. Regardless, even it does bring down her mood for what she&#39;ll have to break to Amitie, she&#39;d rather let her enjoy this moment first. Besides, Ringo wouldn&#39;t do anything drastic in a bit over half an hour&#39;s time.</p>
            <p>Wait it out &#39;till 4:00.</p>
            <h3 id="shopping-district-caf-3-45-pm">Shopping District / café / 3:45 PM</h3>
            <p><em>ding!</em> The bell chimes play as Amitie eagerly waltzes her way on in, Arle quickly following.</p>
            <p>&quot;Here it is!&quot; Amitie exclaims, after a few minutes of walking over. &quot;This is the place.&quot;</p>
            <p>A cozy atmosphere immediately hits the two, which they seem to like rather quickly. The floor has a black and orange checker pattern to it, while the surrounding walls are a dark type of wood. The ceiling has a tile texture to it, sporting a shade of black, with faint, orange lights.</p>
            <p>The actual lights come from the tables and the front desk to order. Each one has a scented candle placed to a plate with its related utensils. The table and chairs themselves are nothing too fancy, but not too bland, either. They have enough character in them to fit well with the dark, yet warm theme going for it.</p>
            <p>Arle&#39;s first thoughts is a &quot;<em>Wow...</em>&quot;, she&#39;s never seen a restaurant this well toned before, having witnessed what fast food spots are like. She&#39;s stunned, really. Few other people are here, so as a mere bonus, it won&#39;t be as awkward figuring out the place. Less people staring.</p>
            <p>&quot;That&#39;s what I was thinking!!&quot; eagerly exclaims Amitie, finding the interior to be marvelous, she&#39;s surprised she hasn&#39;t been here prior until the Halloween decorations caught her eye.</p>
            <p>Unlike Arle, she doesn&#39;t mind if she gets a few looks on checking out a restaurant like this for the first time. &quot;It looks really neat in here.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I like the warm colors, could make for a good photo.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Yeah. It reminds me of my house. I like a warm atmosphere, puts me at ease...&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Heh, that&#39;s true! Anyways, we should order something before we get distracted by whatever else this café has in store. What do you think-&quot;</p>
            <p>By the time she asks Amitie, she&#39;s already walked on off to the nearest vacant table, witnessing the scented candles.</p>
            <p>&quot;-...ink. h-Hey, Am, wait!!&quot; Arle quickly scurries on over to where Amitie is.</p>
            <p>// am is a nickname for amitie, thought it was in character for arle</p>
            <p>&quot;What scent are these? Mint?&quot; she says, stunned by the quality of just the tables themselves. The candle wax itself is contained in a circular glass ball with a hole on the top to put in the candle.</p>
            <p>Arle makes it to the table, next to Amitie. &quot;Jeez, at least tell me before you run off!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! Sorry, I can&#39;t help it! Just look at this place!&quot; Amitie appropriately spins around to amplify her meaning. Arle <em>will</em> admit, she&#39;s definitely right.</p>
            <p>&quot;Heh, yeah.&quot; The mint scent of the table has her at ease. She can definitely see herself and Amitie hanging out here often if...<em>other</em> situations weren&#39;t weighing her down. &quot;Anyways...Am, we should probably order something now before we get people staring at us.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh. Right! What do we order, though?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;d assume they have a menu to choose from.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie shrugs. &quot;No doubt. It&#39;s a café, if they don&#39;t have a menu I&#39;m not sure what they were going for.&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle feels she walked into that one. &quot;...Ah, whatever. Let&#39;s order something. How&#39;s a drink sound?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Sure!&quot; Amitie gets out of her trance of the mint scented candle and starts walking over to the spot to order, the menu items being displayed on television monitors, changing between a set of items every minute or so. Arle follows as well, making sure the duo don&#39;t separate on a whim again.</p>
            <p>The two finally walk their way over to the cashier. The person working behind the counter seems tired, as if they weren&#39;t enjoying their job. Their greeting sounds forced, with a noticeably monotone voice.</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>Welcome...! What&#39;d you like to order.</em>&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie, despite the mood of the cashier, acts as if the person&#39;s doing just fine. &quot;I&#39;ll have a... uhm...&quot;</p>
            <p>She double-checks the menu to find something that catches her eye.</p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;ll have some hot chocolate with cream.&quot;</p>
            <p>The cashier writes the order down, and then looks back to Arle, remaining mute. Arle gets what they&#39;re referring to, though.</p>
            <p>She can see the tiredness in their eyes. &quot;<em>God, I can relate,</em>&quot; she thinks to herself. &quot;<em>I&#39;m weary as well.</em>&quot; Ever since a bit over half an hour ago, the argument&#39;s still been on her mind. What&#39;ll be of Ringo? What is she gonna tell Amitie? What if Ringo never passes the--</p>
            <p>&quot;...Miss?&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle quickly snaps out of it. &quot;h-Huh.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Your order.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh... um...<em>coffee</em>.&quot;</p>
            <p>They continue writing the order without averting eye contact. &quot;What flavor.&quot;</p>
            <p>She stutters to come up with an answer on the spot, resorting to whatever&#39;s the current thing on her mind. &quot;Apple.&quot; Amitie glances, but doesn&#39;t say anything about it.</p>
            <p>A brief period of silence happens between the two, as if the cashier doesn&#39;t even know if something such as &#39;apple coffee&#39; is even real.</p>
            <p>&quot;...Ok.&quot; They finish writing the order and walk to the connected kitchen to prepare the drinks.</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>That was a real item??</em>&quot; she thinks out of sheer surprise. &quot;<em>I just blurted that out on complete accident at a moment&#39;s notice!!</em>&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;That&#39;ll be five dollars.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie voluntarily pays the cashier the five dollars, seeing Arle&#39;s a bit...<em>out of it</em>.</p>
            <p>Flushed out of embarrassment, Arle quickly shuffles to the table that Amitie had an interest in due to the scent. &quot;c-C&#39;mon, Am, let&#39;s go to a table.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Alright.&quot;</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The two swiftly make it to the table. Arle&#39;s hesitant to say much, her head tilted downwards a bit. Amitie can&#39;t help but look at Arle in confusion. Both aren&#39;t sure what to say.</p>
            <p>Before the two can say anything, a waiter shows up to the table, with the hot chocolate and coffee. &quot;Here&#39;s your orders!&quot; they say, passing them to the two respectively.</p>
            <p>&quot;Ah, thank you!&quot; replies Amitie. Arle still can&#39;t say a word, only saying &quot;Mph.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie slowly sips a bit of her hot chocolate, being cautious about the cream on the top of the drink.</p>
            <p>&quot;--! Hot!&quot;</p>
            <p>She jolts, and tries to cool it down by blowing the heat off. After another sip, she can tolerate the heat. Combined with the café&#39;s tone, the scent of mint, and the taste of hot chocolate, it&#39;s as if she were in heaven.</p>
            <p>As she stops sipping from the hot chocolate, she looks back to Arle for a brief moment. Her head&#39;s tilted down as she stares at the apple flavored coffee.</p>
            <p>&quot;What&#39;s that coffee taste like? I&#39;ve never heard of that kind of flavor before...&quot; Amitie&#39;s intrigued with the choice. Saying this, she stirs around her hot chocolate with the spoon they provide, alongside a fork, butter knife, and napkin at each table.</p>
            <p>The longer Arle stares at the dark brown beverage, the more she worries. Either she tells Amitie, or she&#39;s going to have to deal with having given Amitie a sense of false hope and make it worse for herself in the end.</p>
            <p>Ringo obviously doesn&#39;t want to be worried about...she was <em>very</em> vocal on the matter.</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>Maybe drinking it will let me worry less from staring at it.</em>&quot; she thinks. That, and it&#39;ll answer Amitie&#39;s question. Slowly, she picks up the mug and sips it.</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>Who knows? It might taste--</em>&quot;</p>
            <p>Before she can finish thinking on the taste, she immediately spits it out in disgust.</p>
            <p>Amitie&#39;s surprised, having just looked back to her hot chocolate after checking if Arle was doing fine.</p>
            <p>&quot;Gah! This..this tastes <em>awful!</em> This tastes like--&quot; she coughs. &quot;--<em>gasoline!!</em>&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Arle! You good??&quot; Amitie raises a bit from her seat, hands on the table in a knee-jerk reaction.</p>
            <p>The coffee was bitter, admittedly fitting considering the circumstances Arle has herself in, but practicality wise, it tasted terrible. She started coughing from the apple coffee, trying to keep herself together.</p>
            <p>&quot;What&#39;d you <em>think??</em>&quot; she replies back to Amitie on a whim, suffering at the anguish of the coffee she just tried to drink.</p>
            <p>Amitie scurries a bit on her seat, moving her arms around in a hurry. &quot;I-If you want, I can get something to wash it down-&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>NO</em>, No. It&#39;s--&quot; she coughs, a hack thrown in too. &quot;--erg. It&#39;s fine, Am...it&#39;s fine.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie only shows worry as a response. From what she&#39;s seen, Arle doesn&#39;t look fine at all. Not since she got back from that talk with Ringo. Arle&#39;s anxiety practically doubles, now having caused a scene. She just wanted to keep things loose for at least a few minutes.</p>
            <p>Maybe Ringo was right, she was just wasting the time away. There&#39;s a brief period of silence between the two.</p>
            <p>Amitie, worried for her, tries to intervene.</p>
            <p>&quot;...Arle?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;You seem...out of it, since we got to the district a few minutes ago. Are you feeling good?&quot;</p>
            <p>// revise this part</p>
            <p>Arle&#39;s mind runs blank on what she should say. Her head&#39;s racing, and she&#39;s weary from the coffee.</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>I&#39;m doing fine,</em> I’m doing fine.&quot; Arle replies rather quickly before she started to hesitate too long. Amitie’s still concerned, however.</p>
            <p>&quot;You don’t... look like it.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;W-what do you mean?? Everything’s okay!!&quot; Her anxiety only grows the more she tries to get herself out of this, panicking more with each response..</p>
            <p>She doesn’t want to look at the coffee again, turning her eyes away. Amitie’s stare becomes one of concern. The air feels the same as the coffee.</p>
            <p>Bitter.</p>
            <p>The longer she sticks here, the more she wants to leave. She starts to visibly sweat, to the immediate notice of Amitie.</p>
            <p>&quot;Arle, you’re pale.&quot;</p>
            <p>She doesn’t look to Amitie, only keeping her head down. Tears start to form from her eyes.</p>
            <p>&quot;...Is everything alright?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;No.&quot; She finally responds quickly, as if she’s given up with trying to keep the argument in the back burner for any longer. Arle can’t take that kind of pressure.</p>
            <p>Amitie doesn’t know what to do besides trying to talk her way to know what’s going on. Otherwise, she can see her sobbing quietly. &quot;What’s wrong?&quot;</p>
            <p>The two remain silent for what seemed like an eternity. Arle doesn’t move from her position.</p>
            <p>&quot;I-It...It didn’t work out.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;...What?&quot; Amitie takes it slow, asking what she’s taking about.</p>
            <p>She finally tells Amitie. &quot;The conversation with Ringo... It.. I-It ended terribly.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie pauses.</p>
            <p>&quot;Nothing worked. She just...told me I’m wasting her <em>and</em> my time.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie goes from paused to stunned. She thought everything had went fine until now. Arle plants her face onto the table, mentally defeated for the night.</p>
            <p>&quot;I...&quot; --sniff. &quot;I didn’t want to get you into this the moment we entered the café. I thought it would&#39;ve ruined the mood for you.&quot;</p>
            <p>She couldn&#39;t believe what she was hearing at first. Her experience with Ringo had always been pleasant, often willing to help her out when she needed something. She understood why Ringo wasn&#39;t able to do that as of late, but not to where she&#39;d act like that with Arle.</p>
            <p>The new information from Arle gives Amitie a whole new perspective to look at. It bothers her immensely. Painful, even. Dread fills her face.</p>
            <p>&quot;...Oh... oh no.&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle&#39;s sulking only continues.</p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;m s-sorry, Am. I wanted to calm my nerves relaxing somewhere...but I guess <em>that</em> won&#39;t work out for me either, huh.&quot; Her voice is slow, a bit trembly due to her mood. The inclusion of self-destructiveness doesn&#39;t help at all. &quot;Ever since Ringo told me to give her a &#39;damn break&#39;, that&#39;s been on my mind since.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie drinks more of her hot chocolate to try and put herself back together, hating to see Arle at this state.</p>
            <p>&quot;Arle.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;?&quot; She pauses before she was able to continue.</p>
            <p>&quot;This isn&#39;t your fault.&quot; she says, leaning towards Arle, hands on the table. &quot;That&#39;s on Ringo for letting herself get this way. <em>You</em> haven&#39;t done anything wrong.&quot;</p>
            <p>She&#39;s not sure what to say extensively, but anything she <em>does</em> say should hopefully have Arle feel better about herself. &quot;We still have...a whole lot to go through.&quot;</p>
            <p>Retaining her defeated tone, Arle replies back with an unsteady &quot;<em>Yeah.</em>&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;It <em>does</em> sound like this has been a bunch for you to deal with today.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I-I know. I know. I still can&#39;t help but feel... <em>at fault</em> for it...y&#39;know? Having provoked her and all-&quot;</p>
            <p>She speaks up, knowing Arle would carry on to try and explain herself. &quot;<em>This isn&#39;t on you.</em>&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;--huh.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>You</em> don&#39;t need to blame yourself over this. <em>Ringo&#39;s</em> the one we&#39;re worrying about here.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;...Didn&#39;t you say not for me to be too forceful on her, though?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;What about it?&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle does her best to keep eye contact, but can&#39;t help but to look down at her own hands in nervousness.</p>
            <p>&quot;I wanted to mention...I acted a bit forceful at the end before she downright lashed out.&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie tilts her head. &quot;Hm? How much force?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;<em>&#39;You need to take some damn time off&#39;</em> kind of force.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;...Oh.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;...y-Yeah.&quot; She feels incredibly guilty, one of the core reasons she was anxious this whole time. Her confidence wanes.</p>
            <p>Amitie&#39;s not sure how to handle this. Sure, it&#39;s against what she said, but she also doesn&#39;t want to kick Arle while she&#39;s still down. Silent thinking passes before she comes up with something.</p>
            <p>&quot;I can&#39;t blame you for doing that, honestly...I should have figured it&#39;d been tense back there.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;...&quot; She&#39;s not sure what to answer back with, rather not wanting to fully go back through the argument in her head anymore.</p>
            <p>The silence from Arle gives Amitie a clear enough answer. &quot;I&#39;ll take that as a yes.&quot; Arle obliges, nodding.</p>
            <p>&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong,&quot; Amitie continues, &quot;you did what you had to! Thanks for checking in on her.&quot; She finishes the last of her hot chocolate. Arle hasn&#39;t finished her coffee ever since she spat it out.</p>
            <p>&quot;We still got a ways to go, though. Her project isn&#39;t due until Saturday, we&#39;re not exactly in a rush. You definitely look out of wear...the rest will help a lot. Promise?&quot;</p>
            <p>Arle smiles towards her, rather faintly. &quot;Promise. ...T-Thanks for this.&quot;</p>
            <p>She gets up from her chair, stretching her arms. &quot;You want me to bring you to the forest now?&quot;</p>
            <p>Amitie follows, rising from the chair.</p>
            <p>&quot;That&#39;d be great.&quot;</p>

            <h3 id="outskirts">Outskirts</h3>
            <p>A forest flushed in shades of orange with small bits of snow loom over the surface. It&#39;s located outside of the city, and takes around a hour and a half to meet it on foot. While normally barren outside of the large amounts of greenery, the most notable place is a small shack located around the edge. It&#39;s not connected to the rest of the town&#39;s power grid, but it has its own method to produce electricity.</p>
            <p>On a beaten path, a motorcycle with two inhabitants weaves through the turns. The path had been commonly used enough by other trips around the forest that the grass and dirt have bent accordingly due to wear.</p>
            <p>Arle&#39;s driving the motorcycle, while Amitie latches on the same seat. The speed is exhilarating, only amplified by the sounds of the wind roaring through her ears.</p>
