		<!-- <p>rustworld (or rust_world) is a roblox game i'm working on whenever i'm bored to do anything else at the moment. it's one of those decal roleplay games but all of the areas are based off of friend group inside jokes or past work i've done, including really old roblox models from 2016 and prior</p>

		<p>due to my inefficient optimization skills (and also just really big map in general), it'll take a decent system for it to actually run any good. should work fine on a desktop pc or a high end phone</p> -->

		<p>rustworld (or rust_world) is a bulky roblox game that you can explore! in rustworld you can triple jump and double dash around a good handful of worlds scattered across the vast ocean. some worlds come with their own unique skyboxes!</p>

		<p>the areas in this game are comprised of mainly older areas constructed in around 2018-2021, some older, some newer, in a way it's like you're exploring history! very fun</p>

		<p>rustworld also contains the maps for objectbloxia, object create, and lots of structures from those games scattered about. it's your job to locate these odd structures and explore what they have to offer! use the ziplines placed around the game to get to landmarks quickly, and fashionably! that choice is yours</p>

		<p><small>(note! you'll need a decent computer in order to run this game. many large unoptimized models will be there to greet you)</small></p>
