        <h3>Script</h3>

        <p>[Fade in]</p>

        <p>[Scene: Local Hardware store (tools aisle)]</p>

        <p>Nakamura-Sensei, High School Science Teacher, looks tired and she always thinking to herself.<br>
            Coffee mug.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            I've been trying to find a way to get Nano into my hands. Nothing I've tried so far has worked. My latest plan is more of a' a last resort.</p>

        <p>Nakamura walks to the heavyweights aisle of the store, showing various weights and anvils of different shapes and sizes, until she finds the anvil she thinks will work. She attempts to pick it up, puts it on the floor, and pushes it back to the checkout desk.</p>

        <p>The anvil faintly says ACME in it in reference to the old version of the script.</p>

        <p>[Cut to checkout desk]</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (Out of breath)<br>
            I'll purchase this anvil, please.</p>

        <p>Cashier<br>
            (Curiously)<br>
            ...Do you need something to carry that around?</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            N-no, I'm fine.</p>

        <p>Cashier<br>
            Alright then, that'll be $450, please.</p>

        <p>Nakamura gives the money to the cashier, which is tied together with a ribbon. The cashier prints out a receipt, and Nakamura takes it.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (Thinking)<br>
            Even if this is a price to pay to get ahold of Nano, it will definitely be worth it!</p>

        <p>Nakamura pushes the anvil out of the store, dropping the receipt in the street.</p>

        <p>[Cut to a calendar and a clock]</p>

        <p>[One of the day pages fall off, and the clock turns forwards]</p>

        <p>[The next morning]</p>

        <p>[Scene: Shinonome Laboratory (bedroom)]</p>

        <p>Hakase, a young, spoiled, and very young/childish (yet gifted) scientist. Roll cake.</p>

        <p>[An alarm clock, strikes 8:20 AM and plays it's ringtone.]</p>

        <p>[Hakase, whose in her mat, tries to stop the alarm with her hand, but decides to press the button next to the clock, crushing the clock with a hammer, and then a new alarm clock rises from the original spot of the crushed alarm clock, replacing it.]</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (tired)<br>
            *yawn* I feel like every morning just gets shorter and shorter.</p>

        <p>[Hakase grabs a custom-made tablet with an antenna coming out of the top, that shows Nano's abilities, the options to toggle them, along with stability/health.]</p>

        <p>The back of the tablet has a wind-up key for a logo, parodying the iPhone.</p>

        <p>[Scene: Downstairs]</p>

        <p>Include a glass filled with Strawberry juice as it's used later in the script</p>

        <p>Hakase enters the scene, going downstairs.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Well, you're awake early for once. What's the occasion?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (slightly hysterical)<br>
            What's the occasion?!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Calm down, what is it?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            What do you mean, 'what's the occasion?' There's a new season of 'Bobbie McSponge' and I really don't want to miss it.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Wait, so you're all hyped about a new season of a show that probably only the minority cares about?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Minority? Say that again, but slowly.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (slowly)<br>
            Minority.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            *sigh* Not literally' Anyway, what does Nano even watch?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (slightly annoyed)<br>
            I don't know. I didn't program her.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Well, I don't know either, even though I programmed her. Blame neural networks.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            What's a neur-</p>

        <p>The tablet starts beeping, Hakase looks and to her dismay, there is a message on it that says that the rocket punch is loose.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (worried)<br>
            AI stuff, but that's the least of our problems. There's something wrong with Nano, and she's just about to leave!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (concerned, angry)<br>
            ...Alright, since when did you get a-</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Since always! I need to get to Nano before she leaves!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            'Okay.</p>

        <p>Hakase rushes towards Nano, who is just about to open the door.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (distant)<br>
            Nano!</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            (holding door open)<br>
            Hm?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (worried)<br>
            Nano, your arm-</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            Hakase, I can't talk right now, school starts in an hour and a half!</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (still worried)<br>
            This is important!!</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            It's only a hour and a half, Professor. You can tell me when I'm back by 3:00 PM.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (still worried, still)<br>
            But you-</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            If it's about your shark chocolates, then no.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            But-</p>

        <p>Nano stares at Hakase.</p>

        <p>Hakase sighs.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (somewhat defeated)<br>
            ...Fine, I'll tell you after.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            Okay then.</p>

        <p>Nano leaves the house and closes the door behind her.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (frustrated)<br>
            Why did I even bother saying?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Say about what?</p>

        <p>Hakase jumps in surprise.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (stuttering, and also startled)<br>
            What non-functional robot punch?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            '*sigh* What did you do this time with Nano?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (turning back from Sakamoto, crossing arms)<br>
            I' I don't know what you mean!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            I can easily tell you're lying, now tell me what you did with Nano.</p>

        <p>Hakase remains silent.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            When I walked up to you, you said something about a robot punch. What about that did you do with Nano?</p>

        <p>(continued silence)</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            I said n-nothing! I don't know what you're talking about!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            You're a terrible liar. I'll spill your strawberry juice if you don't tell me, and I'll spill it on the rug.</p>

        <p>Hakase gasps in shock.</p>

        <p>(tense silence)</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (crying)<br>
            I'll talk!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Alright, now tell me about this supposed rocket arm.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            I was doing some work with a rocket arm that I gave Nano last week.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Didn't you just give Nano a toaster function last month?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Uhhhh'</p>

        <p>[Flashback: Kitchen]</p>

        <p>Zoom out from eggs cooking, Sakamoto is just kind of standing there in the background</p>

        <p>After a bit, Hakase presses a button on her tablet, causing the top ring of Nano to slide open a bit, shooting 3 slices of toast onto Hakase's plate.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            I thought I said 4 slices-</p>

        <p>Another slice of toast shoots out and lands on to Hakase's face.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (muffled)<br>
            ...Thanks.</p>

        <p>[Zoom back into eggs]</p>

        <p>[end of flashback]</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Oh yeah, now I remember. That was really good toast.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (one word at a time)<br>
            But what about the rocket arm?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            That was last week-</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            No, I mean what about it that's making you so worried?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            *sigh* I... made it too strong.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            ...How strong?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Several tons of force.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (slightly worried)<br>
            Wouldn't that kill someone?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Uh, It could blast someone into pieces and still have enough force to blow through an entire building or two.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            So' Where's Nano off to?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            School.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (breaking down)<br>
            Oh no. Ohhh no.</p>

        <p>
            Hakase<br>
            Is something wr- wrong?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (ultimately worried)<br>
            Of course there's something wrong, kid!! Nano could possibly brutally kill someone with that kind of force! We have to get to her and tell her about her arm now!</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Should we try and chase after her then?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            You're seriously asking that question: Isn't it obvious? Of course we need to chase her!</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Then we should go then!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Then let's go then!</p>

        <p>Hakase and Sakamoto head for the door, but Hakase stops for a second and grabs a juice pack (strawberry flavor)</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            ...Really?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            What? You said you would spill it, and I am not-</p>

        <p>Sakamoto pushes Hakase out the door so they can get to Nano.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (while pushing)<br>
            Let's just get going already.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Fine.</p>

        <p>[Scene: Outside]</p>

        <p>[Halfway from Shinonome Laboratory to School]</p>

        <p>[Cut to Nakamura standing on a streetlamp, tying a rope to the anvil from earlier]</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            What part of me thought that using an anvil would work? '*sigh* Oh well, I'm this far in and there's no going back.</p>

        <p>Nakamura puts the knife close to the rope, waiting for Nano.</p>

        <p>Moments pass.</p>

        <p>[Zoom out (no slide, instant scene change)]</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            Any moment now.</p>

        <p>More moments pass.<br>
            The camera slowly zooms out of the shot in a fading sequence.</p>

        <p>[Short intermission bumper]</p>

        <p>[Cut to Tokisadame High School: Bottom floor, hallway]</p>

        <p>(CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS WHATEVER)</p>

        <p>Weboshi, Fe-chan and Misato are walking down the hallway.</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            So, Fe-chan, what are you going to do when the weekend comes?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            I'm planning to host a house party this saturday night.</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            (questioning)<br>
            Why would you do that? By what I've seen, house parties usually end up as a wreck.</p>

        <p>[Background - Nano walks in through a door, Weboshi, Misato and Fe-chan don't notice]</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Misato's right, if you want to plan a house party, at least know what you're doing.</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            For example, do you invite via posters or via invitations?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (curious)<br>
            I'm not sure, actually! What do you two think would be the best?</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Definitely via invitations, if you're just going to go and invite people who're interested to come over to your house, it's probably going to be a disaster in the end.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            So' more of a 'girl's night out' then?</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            Whatever floats your boat, I guess. However, I'm not the kind of person who enjoys shopping or y'know, that kind of stuff.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Hmm. Well, do you want to come then?</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Sure.</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            I'll also come if it bothers you that much.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            No, no, it's fine. Who else should I invite?</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            Possibly those three at class 1-Q.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            You mean Yuuko, Mio, and Mai?</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Isn't Nano there too?</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            Yeah, her too.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            I'll see if I can invite them!</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Sounds good.</p>

        <p>As the three walk, the camera slides to the 1-Q door, and the scene goes to inside the class.</p>

        <p>Sakurai<br>
            Today, we have a test on Japanese.</p>

        <p>Background chatter is heard in the background.</p>

        <p>Yukko sighs.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            What is it, Yukko?</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            I didn't study'</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            (unamused)<br>
            ...Again.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Yeah, again.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Yukko, look. One day you'll have to do homework yourself, and not rely on copying others homework, like mine or Mai's. One day, we won't be there.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (disappointed)<br>
            ...Oh.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            ...What I'm trying to say is to believe in yourself, just try and do the test anyways.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (slowly becoming determined)<br>
            ...I'll try!</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            There you go!</p>

        <p>Sakurai<br>
            Everyone, please remain seated and silent: the tests are being handed out.</p>

        <p>Papers are passed out, and everyone but Yukko starts writing. Yukko looks at her paper, stern to complete the test.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            I can't do this.</p>

        <p>[Cut back to Nakamura]</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (tired, thinking)<br>
            I've been waiting for an entire hour now, where is she??</p>

        <p>Annaka walks past Nakamura, and then stops and turns around.</p>

        <p>Annaka<br>
            (confused)<br>
            ...What are you doing?</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (startled, still a bit tired)<br>
            *yawn* Huh, what?</p>

        <p>Annaka<br>
            L-look, whatever it is, school does start in about half an hour, you should get going.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (starting to fall asleep)<br>
            I'm doing this' for a'</p>

        <p>Nakamura falls asleep, and accidentally cuts the rope, breaking the streetlamp along with it due to the pressure, as Nakamura falls down and lands on the anvil.</p>

        <p>Nano finally walks up to the broken streetlight.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            (confused)<br>
            What happened here? ...And why is Nakamura unconscious?</p>

        <p>Nano's inbuilt watch beeps.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            (surprised)<br>
            30 minutes until school starts?! I gotta get going!</p>

        <p>Nano continues walking, and looks back at Nakamura, not waking up.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            ...I should bring her as well.</p>

        <p>Nano goes back to Nakamura, and starts dragging her as Nano walks to school.</p>

        <p>Annaka<br>
            (confused)<br>
            Ehhhhh??</p>

        <p>[Cut to Hakase and Sakamoto]</p>

        <p>Hakase and Sakamoto are running, out of breath, and tired.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (whining)<br>
            I want to go back home!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (annoyed)<br>
            What about that rocket punch? I'm pretty sure you don't want something that you've made to just go and blow someone to bits!</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            But I want to sleep!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Well, that's just too bad, isn't it?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto and Hakase run past a juice stand</p>

        <p>Hakase slows down slightly, looking back at the stand</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            You're not having any juice until we sort Nano out.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Aw!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Wait, didn't you bring a pack of strawberry juice earlier?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (looking away)<br>
            ...No.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            I can tell you're lying.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            I'm not lying!!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            *sigh* Can we just continue on? We'll get the juice after.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Fine!</p>

        <p>Hakase and Sakamoto dash out of the scene, only for Hakase to run right for the stand only a few seconds later, with Sakamoto trying to stop Hakase.</p>

        <p>[Short intermission bumper]</p>

        <p>[Calendar cutscene, but the time changes instead of the calendar]</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            So, kid. Do you know where the school is?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            Uhh' No.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto stops.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Wait, so you're telling me that you don't know where the school is?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Nope.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Then where are we supposed to go in the first place to get there?</p>

        <p>Hakase looks around and notices a broken streetlamp with a trail of coffee.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (curious)<br>
            How about that trail?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Why? How can we be so sure it leads to the school?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            What else do we have?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            A GPS?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            The GPS doesn't work.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Why not?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            How should I know? I thought the satellite I built was working the time I launched it into space.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Wait, what?</p>

        <p>[Cut to the satellite being stuck on the moon, then cut back to Hakase and Sakamoto]</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            ...Nevermind, let's just follow the trail!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (bored)<br>
            ...Whatever.</p>

        <p>[Cut to Fe-chan]</p>

        <p>[Highschool, bottom floor | hallway | corkboard]</p>

        <p>Fe-chan pins a paper onto the corkboard.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            That should do!</p>

        <p>Weboshi notices Fe-chan at the corkboard and walks up to her.</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Hey Fe-chan.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Hm?</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            I thought you were going to invite select people?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Well, I was deciding between invitations or people who are interested, so I ultimately decided to go for the other option, simply because it would have more people come over. Also, it was hard choosing select people, since I think everyone here is great equally.</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Well, at least you know what you're doing. Good luck with the house party!</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Thanks!</p>

        <p>[Cut to Hakase and Sakamoto]</p>

        <p>Hakase and Sakamoto both follow the trail of coffee, looking directly at the ground, soon later the trail ends.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Seems like the trail ends here.</p>

        <p>Both of them simultaneously look up and see Nakamura on the ground under a pool of coffee. Next to her is a giant machine.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Look!</p>

        <p>Hakase points at the giant machine next to Nakamura.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            You're just going to ignore the woman on the ground?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            It's a recovery unit!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            A what.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            You don't know what a recovery unit is?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Listen here, it's no time to play games, we have to find Na-</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            It brings dead people back to life!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Stop talking nonsense, I said we have to find Na-</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            But it does bring people back to life!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Stop talking about this 'Recovery unit', it's not real.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Then what is it?!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            I don't know, maybe it just burns garbage! What I do know is that that isn't a 'recovery unit'-</p>

        <p>Before Sakamoto can finish, the machine turns on and starts shaking rapidly.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (nervously)<br>
            Um' Should we run?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Don't worry, it's safe.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            How do you even know that?!</p>

        <p>The machine stops shaking and it opens, Makoto leaves the machine.</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            Jeez, I gotta be careful while training Igo Soccer, I don't want to die a third time.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto stares intensely at the situation he had just witnessed.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Wha' Wha, wha, what in the'</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            See? I told you so! You owe me a box of apple juice now!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            When did we agree on that?! Wha-what was that?! What happened?!</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            The machine regenerated a school boy.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Bu-but how?! How even!?</p>

        <p>Hakase walks forwards.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Don't ignore me! Hey!</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            'Sakamoto you're being too noisy, we have to find Nano now, come on.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            He-hey! Arrrrgh! Forget it! Wh-what should we do now?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Ah.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            You don't know, do you?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            I, umm' How about we ask the boy?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            *sigh* It's the only thing we can do now, isn't it?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Hey mister!</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            (turns around)<br>
            Eh? Me?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Hey, kid! Could you tell us where Tokisadame school is located?</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            (raises eyebrow)<br>
            'Pfft' Hahahahaha!!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto and Hakase<br>
            (tilt heads)<br>
            Eh?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Um, mister?</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            (keeps laughing)</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Le-let's get out of here, I think we asked the wrong person.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (scared)<br>
            Ye-yeah'</p>

        <p>Sakamoto and Hakase start walking away slowly.</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            (while laughing)<br>
            W-wait! Pfft- It's just, it's just'</p>

        <p>[Hakase and Sakamoto turn around]</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            You are at Tokisadame school, that's all! And when you came and asked me' such a dumb question, I... Pfft! I just couldn't hold it!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (embarrassed)<br>
            It- It's not that funny!</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (embarrassed)<br>
            Y-yeah!</p>

        <p>Makoto leaves before they know it.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (angry)<br>
            Where did he go?!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (angry)<br>
            You know what? Forget him! He said this was Tokisadame School. If it really is, then let's search for an entrance.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (angry)<br>
            Al-alright'</p>

        <p>[Cut to Makoto]</p>

        <p>Makoto is seen on the other side of the school, he walks towards a door with a weird device where the handle should be, he takes out a card and puts it in the machine, opening the door.</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            Ah, I'm lucky that I didn't forget my student ID at home, otherwise I'd be in too much trouble.</p>

        <p>Makoto walks through the door, which leads to the school's hallway on the first floor.</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            ...I wouldn't be able to get in after dying like it normally happens.</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            It's weird though, why do I have to go through the back door instead of the front door? ' Meh, who cares, I have to get back to class.</p>

        <p>[Cut to Makoto in the hallway, a few feet away from the corkboard]</p>

        <p>Before Weboshi and Fe-chan can leave, Makoto sees the paper Fe-chan placed on the corkboard, Makoto looks at the paper</p>

        <p>(Show a childish house party invitation)</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            Pfft...</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Eh?</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            Who made this?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (getting the wrong idea)<br>
            E-eh? Um, so-sorry, but I think mainly girls are going to the house party and, uh, I don't know if you'd feel comforta-</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            (smirking)<br>
            It looks so childish.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan and Weboshi<br>
            Ah.</p>

        <p>[Cut to Fe-chan's heart]</p>

        <p>Fe-chan's heart shatters in two, glass shattering is heard.</p>

        <p>[Cut back to Makoto, Weboshi and Fe-chan]</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            Are these supposed to be people?</p>

            We-well, uh'</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            They look like a four year old drew it.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Ah.</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            (turns around, unaware)<br>
            What is it?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            ...I'</p>

        <p>Makoto raises his eyebrow and looks at Fe-chan</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (heartbroken)<br>
            I' I know ri-right? Th-they look so, so bad!</p>

        <p>Makoto<br>
            I know right? Oh! I forgot I was supposed to go!</p>

        <p>Makoto leaves, unaware of the heartbroken girl, Fe-chan slowly grabs the paper</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            'I guess it does look like a four year old drew it'</p>

        <p>Weboshi who has been there the whole time, pats her back</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            He-hey, Fe-chan, cheer up! He probably was unaware that you made it.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            '</p>

        <p>Fe-chan takes off the paper</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (sad)<br>
            Y-you know what' Maybe I won't make the house party.</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Eh?! Bu-but you've been talking about it the whole day!</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (sad)<br>
            Maybe' Maybe next week. Can we go back to classes now?</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            'If it makes you happy, I can buy juice for you.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (forgets past events)<br>
            Gasp! Really?</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            (smiles)<br>
            Yeah'</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            She completely changed after I told her I'd buy her juice'</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (excited)<br>
            I'm kind of thirsty right now, can we buy it already?</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            (happy)<br>
            Sure.</p>

        <p>Weboshi and Fe-chan walk away from the scene. After a short bit, Fe-chan hears Hakase and Sakamoto, she stops and looks out the window out of curiosity to figure out where the noise is coming from.</p>

        <p>[Outside the School]</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            The door is locked!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Well, that's just great.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            No it's not!!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Kid, when are you going to realize when I'm sarcastic and when I'm not sarcastic?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            ...Are you being sarcastic now?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            About earlier, yes.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Oh' Well, how do you think we're going to get across this locked door?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            We can't.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            What do you mean?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            I mean, there's no possible way we can get through this door. It's locked, we can't go over it, and there's no form of doorbell or anything to use to get someone to open the door to begin with.</p>

        <p>[Cut back to Fe-chan and Weboshi]</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Wait, Weboshi, there's someone out the window trying to get in the building!</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Huh? Who are they?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (trying to look out the window farther)<br>
            I don't know, they're too far to recognize!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Uh, then we just wait here?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            No, but at the same time yes' Wait, what did I mean?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto looks around for something to get him and Hakase inside.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            ...Hey, I think I see an open window in the building.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Wait, so you're saying we should get someone's attention?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            That was the point.</p>

        <p>Hakase gets a bunch of sticks and somehow builds a (small) fully functional wooden rocket out of them</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            ...What-</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            It's something I learned how to do a while ago. The engine's made of compressed air.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Well, what are you going to do with that rocket? And don't try to blast a hole through the gate to pass through, that'd make things worse.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Why would I blast through the gate?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            So what's the point of the rocket then? Is it like a firework?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Just you find out and see!</p>

        <p>Hakase throws the rocket at the ground and it bounces back up. The rocket flickers on and it flies straight through the open window of 1-Q</p>

        <p>Sound effects of breaking glass and then other destruction noises, Sakamoto looking in horror</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            (distressed)<br>
            You just said you wouldn't blast through the window! What are you doing?!</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Getting attention, Besides, I only said through the gate.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            But you're still destroying other property!</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            It's only about the size of a toy anyway!</p>

        <p>[Cut to the school hallway]</p>

        <p>Fe-chan is impaled by the rocket.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Urgh...</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            (startled)<br>
            Uh' Fe-chan?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan falls onto the ground face first</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            ...I think she's dead.</p>

        <p>Weboshi looks outside the window</p>

        <p>[Cut to Hakase and Sakamoto]</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (shouting in order for Weboshi to hear her)<br>
            Did I break anything??</p>

        <p>[Back to Weboshi]</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            (also shouting in order for Hakase to hear her)<br>
            Well, you killed Fe-chan!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto stares sternly at Hakase</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (shouting)<br>
            Fair enough!</p>

        <p>[Short intermission bumper, then cut to Yukko and Mio]</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (trying to tape together test)<br>
            Mio, should we go check on Nano?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            We're in the middle of a practice test for midterms, so I'm not sure if its-</p>

        <p>Yukko points at the hole in the ceiling and coughs</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            ...Fine, what's your idea on getting out of this?</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            The idea I have is that we're going to come up with an excuse so we can get out the door.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            What excuse will I use?</p>

        <p>Yukko thinks for a moment.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (a tad bit slower)<br>
            Uhhhh, just try and go with the flow.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            '(sigh) Okay.</p>

        <p>Yukko intentionally smudges some pencil graphite onto her hand</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            I see.</p>

        <p>Yukko raises her hand, waiting for Sakurai to notice.</p>

        <p>A short moment passes.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            ...How long does this take?</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (slowly getting impatient)<br>
            Any moment now'</p>

        <p>Mio rolls her eyes.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Hang on, wait a minute.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (arm starting to shake)<br>
            Huh?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Notice how Sakurai hasn't seemed to have told the class to be quiet yet? She hasn't even said anything at all for that matter.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (puts down hand)<br>
            Only now, actually.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            ...That's because she's asleep.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Teachers can do that?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            ...Well, the school bell rings at the end of the test.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            So, we should sneak out?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Either that or we go for your plan.</p>

        <p>Yukko looks at Sakurai, whos sleeping.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Your idea is better, come to think of it.</p>

        <p>Yukko and Mio get up out of their chairs and crawl to the door while everyone else stares at them.</p>

        <p>Annaka<br>
            ...E-</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Shhhhh.</p>

        <p>Annaka<br>
            (very quietly)<br>
            Ehhhh??</p>

        <p>Mio and Yukko eventually reach the door, before very quickly dashing out of it</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (relieved)<br>
            Phew. Now that that's done, what next?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            We go and find Nano, obviously.. Do you have the memory of a goldfish?</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Uh, no.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            *sigh of disbelief* Seems like it.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (fake relief)<br>
            Phew. Now that that's done, what next?</p>

        <p>Mio facepalms</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            There's no time for this, come on!</p>

        <p>Yukko follows Mio.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            So uh, wouldn't Nano just be straight up?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            That's what I'm thinking.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            So if Nano went straight up, we'll have to go up some floors to figure out where she stopped at!</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            The question is, how many floors?</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Better not be a lot, I'm not a fan of stairs.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            We have an elevator, you know.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Oh. I always took the stairs'</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Well at least you're getting exercise, however we have to take the quick way up.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            No arguing with that!</p>

        <p>[Cut to inside the school elevator]</p>

        <p>The elevator door opens, and Yukko and Mio walk in, and proceed to look at the array of buttons.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Which floor should we go to first?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Hmm' Well, I saw that the hole in the ceiling lasted for roughly 3 or so floors, so let's start at Floor 4.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Okay then.</p>

        <p>Yukko presses the button tagged with '4', meaning floor 4. The elevator dings once the button is pressed, and the doors close. Then, the elevator goes up, while some music plays in the background.</p>

        <p>[Scene: Nakamura is asleep in the school field, close to the school regeneration unit]</p>

        <p>Fe-chan gets regenerated by the SGU (school regeneration unit) and notices Nakamura on the ground.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Nakamura?</p>

        <p>Nakamura doesn't respond.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Hm, must be asleep.</p>

        <p>Nakamura then wakes up.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Huh? What? Where am I?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (startled)<br>
            AH! Man, you scared me!</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Oh, good afternoon, Fe-chan. How long was I here for, and what time is it?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            I just got back from.. Being dead, and'</p>

        <p>Fe-chan looks at the clock located at the top of the entrance wall.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            It's about 1:49 PM.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Period 4? Isn't that when I have to do Science?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Well, you did pass out, so Sakurai suggested we'd do a test we were originally going to do on Friday today instead because we already knew the material well enough!</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            ...Oh. Then what are you doing, then?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            I was originally going to return back to the lesson, but then you were just sort of laying there on the ground'</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            I still haven't figured out why I was here instead of on the sidewalk.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Well, I haven't seen you anywhere else today, so I'm unsure how you ended up here'</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Oh.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Moving on, I heard something happened in 1-Q earlier,</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            And...what would that be?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Apparently, Nano accidentally fired her rocket punch and blasted herself through several floors...</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            Nano? This gives me an idea'<br>
            Nano? I have just the perfect plan...</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (slightly anxious)<br>
            Fe-chan, what floor is she on?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Unsure, but she definitely did go through 2 or more floors.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Alright, I'll go check if she's alright.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            ...Alright. I'm going back to class.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            You do that.</p>

            Haven't gotten a full picture yet, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.</p>

            Hey, I'm back.</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Fe-chan! Where have you been? I thought you would've been here sooner!</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Well, I saw Nakamura outside, and that's the only thing that delayed me getting here.</p>

            ...Oh.</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            Why was she outside?</p>

            I personally think it should be best left a secret.</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            (confused)<br>
            ...Ok?</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Well, at least she's fine, right?</p>

            Positive.</p>

        <p>Misato is holding an open bucket of (blue) paint, (with two eyes floating around near the edge, barely visible [BFB CAMEO]) attempting to pour some of it onto her palette: the sudden arrival of Mio and Yukko startles her and throws the paint up and it lands straight on her work, along with making her launch a rocket by accident, and then the rocket aims for the paint bucket.</p>

            Nothing, nothing.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            ...Alright, should I go in first?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            I'd probably have a nervous breakdown if I went in first, so you go on right ahead.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Alright.</p>

            Well Mio, I don't see why you're scared of this place, it seems fine.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            That's because they cleaned up the accident, far as I see.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (questioning)<br>
            Also, is it just me or is Nano still conscious? You got a stick, Mio?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Not really, but there's some small wood chunks over there near the wood cutters that could be taped together.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            That works too, I guess'</p>

        <p>[Class 4-A]</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (Drying self with towel)<br>
            I don't blame you, Misato. I was startled too.</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Well, I have to do my painting all over again, since it's covered in blue paint.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Don't worry, Weboshi! At least you have a fair idea of what you're painting this time.</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            (looking at her painting, still half covered in blue paint)<br>
            ...Yeah.</p>

        <p>[Class 4-B]</p>

        <p>Yukko slowly walks up to Nano and prods Nano with the stick, made out of taped together wood chunks.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Well, she seems unconscious by the looks of it.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            How should we get her out of the ceiling?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Maybe Hakase would know how. She did build Nano, after all.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            That's a good idea, but the question is' Where is Hakase? Has she already gone to get to her?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Should we go back down to Floor 1 and see? The gate to enter here is usually closed at this point, so she could be stuck right outside the gate. Maybe she also brought Sakamoto, since he's, y'know, older than her, making him a 'supervisor' to her.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (in agreement)<br>
            I don't see why not.</p>

        <p>[Cut back to Hakase and Sakamoto]</p>

        <p>Hakase throws a small pebble at the gate, in desperate attempts to open it.</p>

            (sits with her arms around her legs, feeling hopeless )<br>
            Well, I've done all I can do.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            What about just trying to get someones- No, wait, that ended out as a disaster.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Maybe we could try going over?</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            I don't see how you could have any more materials to make something else. There's nothing here for a distance.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            If I can make a rocket out of sticks and whatever else, this is nothing!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            You do you, then.</p>

        <p>[Cut to Nakamura]</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (concerned)<br>
            What are you doing?</p>

        <p>Yukko is startled by Nakamura's appearance, and both Mio and Yukko stop.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            I' Um...</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            We're' going to uhh' the...</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            ...Shouldn't you be in class?</p>

        <p>Mio's wristwatch beeps, signalling the end of the test.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            That's not good.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Uh, yeah, we should be in class. Nice to meet you.</p>

        <p>Mio tugs Yukko, signalling them to get back to Q-1,</p>

        <p>[brief cut to 1-Q]</p>

        <p>Sakurai wakes up, startled but still seems half-asleep</p>

        <p>Sakurai<br>
            (somewhat slurred)<br>
            (yawn) Uh, the test is over, please hand in your tests,</p>

        <p>Annaka<br>
            Mine's dust'</p>

        <p>Sakurai<br>
            (still slurred)<br>
            You mean dusted?</p>

        <p>Annaka<br>
            (holding dust of her test)<br>
            I meant, actual dust.</p>

        <p>Sakurai<br>
            ...Oh.</p>

        <p>[cut back to Yukko, Mio, and Nakamura]</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (whispering)<br>
            But what about Na-</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            (whispering)<br>
            What about us?</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (whispering)<br>
            Alright, fine..</p>

        <p>Yukko and Mio dash back to the elevator and the doors close.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            ...Okay then.</p>

        <p>Nakamura enters the authorised personnel room.</p>

        <p>[Floor 1 - Authorised Personnel Room/Security]</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            With this security camera footage, I should figure out where Nano is located.</p>

        <p>Nakamura walks up to the monitor, and the flips through the footage until she eventually finds video of Nano embedded in the ceiling.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (thinking)<br>
            Bingo' Ah...<br>
            Finally I can figure out what's inside of her and make tons of money- or build my own tools and contraptions'</p>

        <p>Nakamura leaves the room</p>

        <p>[Room 4-B]</p>

        <p>(silence for a moment)</p>

        <p>Nano regains consciousness.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            Where-</p>

        <p>Nakamura opens the door.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Oh. There you are. Was wondering where you went.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            N-Nakamura! What're you doing here? I'm stuck in the ceiling!</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Well, you've been stuck in there for a longer time than usual, and the bell just rang, so I thought you were still here as a conclusion.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            Well, c-can you get me out of here?</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            I'm going to do that. Anyways, by the looks of it, the best possible option to get you out of the floor and onto the floor is to have something weigh you down, like a block of concrete or a gym weight.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            But' I-I don't see anything that could possibly do that!</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Well, besides a taped together stick of wood chunks, but that's not even close to capable. I'll go get something from the gym to get you down. I already have my time off due to my unconsciousness from earlier today.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            Alright, I'll just' S-stay here, I g-guess.</p>

        <p>Nakamura exits 4-B.</p>

        <p>[Outside Gate]</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Kid, we've been standing here all morning. Do you have even the slightest idea on how to get over?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            The only way now is to break it. Nothing else worked!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            But you said you wouldnt break the gate!</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Well, uh,</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Kid, if you really want to go through property damage and the res-</p>

        <p>Hakase pulls what looks like a pen out of her pocket and it folds out into a laser gun.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Property shmoperty. I'll just blast the door with a laser gun.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            You have a laser gun?! All this time wasted and NOW you say you have a laser gun?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (ecstatically ignorant)<br>
            'Yes!</p>

        <p>Hakase shoots the gate with the laser gun, and it explodes in half, one flying towards the school entrance: It flies through another open door and slices Fe-chan in half.</p>

        <p>[cut to Fe-chan's dead corpse]</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            This again?<br>
            (sigh)</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            I wonder what Fe-chan's actual fla- flavour-</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            Don't.</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Alright, fine, I'll resist my temptation.</p>

        <p>[back to Hakase and Sakamoto]</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Congratulations. You killed someone' again.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            But the gate's open now.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Yeah, but killing people-</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            ' The gate's open, and we have no time to waste!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            But-</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            No.</p>

        <p>Hakase walks through the gate and Sakamoto reluctantly follows.</p>

        <p>[cut to school recovery unit]</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            I wonder if I'm going to be accused of skipping lessons due to all this time I've been outside'</p>

        <p>The recovery unit shakes again, and the Principal comes out of it.</p>

        <p>Principal<br>
            (walking past)<br>
            Don't worry, you're not the only one who dies more than once.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Eh?! Principal?!</p>

        <p>Principal<br>
            I suggest you go back to class now.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Bu-but' Okay...</p>

        <p>[cut to Nano]</p>

        <p>Nakamura opens the door, holding a magnet</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            This magnet should pull you down.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            You sure?</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            If this magnet isn't strong enough, I'll have to use force to get you unstuck or pry you out</p>

        <p>Nakamura throws the magnet, and instead of attracting Nano, it attracts every other piece of metal</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Ugh.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            Any other ideas?</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Maybe I could try getting something so I can pull you down instead of using magnetic force.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            I guess?</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Alright, hang in there while you still can.</p>

        <p>Nakamura closes the door.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            ...I wonder if I can get myself out of here.</p>

        <p>Nano switches one of her arms into a gun and slowly aims to the ceiling she's stuck in.</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            (careful, arm shaking)<br>
            Nice and easy'</p>

        <p>[cut to Yukko and Mio]</p>

        <p>
            [faint bang sound, scream. Sakurai is startled by the explosion, along with the rest of the class]</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            (distant, in pain)<br>
            Ow, my eye!</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            What was that?</p>

        <p>Mio gets up and looks through the hole in the ceiling</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Looks like Nano is trying to get down herself.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            So that would explain the bang'</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Yeah, now we should worry on what happens if Nano gets herself down, because she'll fall from the ceiling.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Wouldn't it be a ceiling?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            From the floor below it.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            Then wouldn't it be a Cloor?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            What type of made up name is that?</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            A name I would come up with.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            (to herself)<br>
            Cloor. What an odd word.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            What?</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Nothing.</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            (unaware)<br>
            Okie Dokie!</p>

        <p>Mio has a concerned look on her face.</p>

        <p>[cut to Nano]</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            (switches arm back to normal)<br>
            ...Right, maybe a gun wasn't the best idea' What else could possibly work?</p>

        <p>Nano's hand switches through various items until it becomes a chainsaw</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            A chainsaw?! Since when did I have this? ...I guess it'll work in this case.</p>

        <p>Nano begins to slice the ceiling before Nakamura opens the door</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Uh, What are you doing?</p>

        <p>Nano<br>
            (running chainsaw through ceiling)<br>
            Trying to get myself out of this ceiling.</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Well, it seems to be work-</p>

        <p>Nano suddenly falls and screams, along with the piece of wood</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            '-ing...</p>

        <p>[Brief cut to Hakase and Sakamoto looking through a window to see Nano falling.]</p>

        <p>[Cut back to Nakamura]</p>

        <p>Nakamura walks forward, looking down the hole to see Nano landing on a desk</p>

        <p>[silence]</p>

        <p>Sakamoto and Hakase open the door of 1-Q</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Uh...</p>

        <p>Silence continues- until it is broken by Nano's CPU overload</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Right, we should definitely take her home now.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Probably a good idea.</p>

        <p>[silence]</p>

        <p>Yukko<br>
            ...I would say something about this, but I'm out of ideas.</p>

        <p>Mio<br>
            Yeah' me too.</p>

        <p>Nakamura walks through the door but realises Hakase and Sakamoto got there first</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Uh'</p>

        <p>Nakamura walks out and closes the door</p>

        <p>[cut to Nakamura outside the class (hallway)]</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            (defeated, to self)<br>
            Of course, things always have to go wrong last second.</p>

        <p>Suddenly, the bell goes, and a voice comes on</p>

        <p>idea: cameo reference from bfdi regarding the voice and possible appearance of the speakers themselves</p>

        <p>Principal<br>
            (from school speaker)<br>
            Due to major damage, School has been closed early for the day. Please return home.</p>

        <p>Everyone swarms down the hallway, towards Nakamura</p>

        <p>Nakamura<br>
            Uh oh...</p>

        <p>[cut to Fe-chan/Weboshi/Misato, in a library]</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Thanks for helping me make the posters digitally guys. I don't know anything about computers, compared to you guys!</p>

        <p>Fe-chan takes sips from her juice.</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            No need to thank us, we're your friends after all!</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            You're talking as if we're computer experts, Fe-chan, you should really learn a bit more, this is basic stuff.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            I know, I know. I should listen more at class.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan takes more sips.</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            You'll have to pay me for that juice later, you know that?</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (spits out drink)<br>
            Eh?! I thought it was free!</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            I was planning to buy my own juice with that money, so you'll have to pay me back tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (sad)<br>
            Awwwww...</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            I still can't believe you took off the paper simply because some guy made fun of it.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            What?</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            What I'm saying is that you should be more tolerant, I'm pretty sure everyone else would've gone to your house party without caring about the poster's quality.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Who cares? Now the poster will look cooler! Is that not better?</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            I, I guess? What you did was still pretty childish though. I would've kept the poster on the corkboard.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Eh?! It's not childish!</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            It kinda is though...</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Weboshi! Help me on this!</p>

        <p>Weboshi<br>
            Well' Cancelling a party simply because of someone's opinion is kinda childish.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            Eh?!</p>

        <p>Misato<br>
            See? I told you so.</p>

        <p>Fe-chan<br>
            (angry)<br>
            We-well, you-you'd be shooting missiles left and right if, if your crush, Sa-Sasahara trashed your painting! Wouldn't that be more chi-childish?!</p>

        <p>Sound of multiple explosions</p>

        <p>Camera shakes violently and the librarian's glasses and book fall off</p>

        <p>Librarian<br>
            Wha-what?!</p>

        <p>Shinonome Laboratory, Night</p>

        <p>Sakamoto and Hakase are inspecting the damage on Nano.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            I'm amazed at how Nano hasn't just broken in half, I mean, she blasted herself through several floors, apparently shot her own eye, falling back down and then finally landing on a table, breaking it in the process.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (applying square eyepatch to Nano's eye)<br>
            I'm just thankful she's still alive. If she had any more damage, she would've just broke into pieces!!</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Well, maybe next time you should take better care for her too, and not just yourself, kid.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (grabbing a strawberry juice carton)<br>
            But Nano didn't listen to me when I tried saying.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            You're overwhelming her, since she also has school and her own persona to worry about, too. That also explains why she passed out when we found her on a broken desk.</p>

        <p>
            Hakase<br>
            (sounding defeated)<br>
            Let's just hope this doesn't happen again'</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            Yeah. Also, make sure she's ready for tomorrow this time.</p>

        <p>Hakase sighs and opens the carton</p>

        <p>A small droplet lands on the motherboard, without anyone noticing</p>

        <p>[focus on the droplet]</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Everything appears to relatively fine, only a few parts have taken damage which is just-</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            How do you keep breaking physics like this?</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            ...I dunno, ask physics.</p>

        <p>Hakase removes the damaged parts and opens a box full of working parts</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            I never thought we'd have to use that box.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Me neither, but it seems like some important parts are broke as well, and need replacement.</p>

        <p>Sakamoto<br>
            As I said, just make sure she's ready for tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            Alright.</p>

        <p>[later timecard]</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            And that should fix it.</p>

        <p>Hakase looks at Sakamoto, who's sleeping.</p>

        <p>Hakase<br>
            (tired)<br>
            *yawn* I should go sleep as well'</p>

        <p>Hakase closes the front of Nano, and carefully brings her over to her bed, trying not to cause any further damage.</p>

        <p>Hakase then turns off the light, gets to her own bed, and falls asleep.</p>

        <p>[episode end credits]</p>

        <p>[after credits scene, shinonome lab]</p>

        <p>Hakase, Sakamoto, and Nano are sleeping. Nano electrocutes for a split second, but no one is woke up by it.</p>
