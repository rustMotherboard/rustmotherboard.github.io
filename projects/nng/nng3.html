        <h2>Episode 3 - Fe-chan's House Party</h2>
        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <h4>Act 1</h4>

        <p>Episode starts in the computer lab at school, Misato, Fechan and Weboshi are talking about the party, they make a 100 papers, Misato and Weboshi think it's too much, but Fechan decides to ignore them and says that she'll put them all over the school</p>

        <p>Jump to the next day, Misato, Fechan and Weboshi are having lunch together, Misato decides to go buy something from the vending machine, which is in the outside of the school, as she goes, she realizes that throughout the hallways, no party papers are seen.</p>

        <p>Misato comes back and questions Fechan about why there weren't any party papers, Fechan tries to get out of the situation, but the truth is eventually found out, she decided to only invite friends instead of everyone, Misato and Weboshi decide to just shrug it off. Fechan says she invited 20 people, Misato and Weboshi argue whether or not that is actually enough for a party, but none of that changes Fechan's choices. (Characters included are: Weboshi and Misato, along with Nano, Mai, Mio and Yuuko, others invited also include Sasahara, the other 13 are simply friends of Fechan from other schools who aren't important)</p>

        <p>Timeskip, the bell rings and it's time for students to leave and go home, as Misato and Weboshi plan on leaving, Fechan says that she actually forgot to take out all 100 party papers from her school bag, so Fechan decides to go to the nearest trash container (ignoring the trash can in class, because she doesn't want anyone to see them, which Misato and Weboshi fail to see why someone would search a trash can), as Fechan runs through the hallways with the 100 papers, one of them falls without her realizing, she catches up to Misato and Weboshi and they leave to prepare for the party.</p>

        <p>As students are walking through the halls, Annaka sees a paper on the floor, she realizes it's a party paper, she thinks that it fell from the wall so she decides to put it back on with tape.</p>

        <p>After Annaka leaves, Makoto enters the hallway, unable to think of anything to do, however, on the wall he sees an invitation to a party, he gets the idea to call his friends to go to this party with him.</p>

        <p>Jump to locker room. Yuuko, Mai, Mio and Nano are talking, when they open their lockers and see invitations to a party, they all decide on going.</p>

        <p>After walking home from school, Yuuko, Mio, Mai and Nano all go their separate ways, as Nano walks home alone, a malfunction happens.</p>

        <p>After Nano walks away, inside the bushes Nakamura pops out, revealing that she had been following her even as Nano was walking with her friends. Nakamura gets to the conclusion that something is wrong with Nano and she heard just before that she was apparently going to a party, she starts thinking of what could happen if something could go wrong at the party, putting the other students at risk from Nano's malfunctions (However, in reality, Nakamura is only trying to think of excuses to keep spying on Nano), so she decides to go to the party, ready to follow Nano when she goes to the party (Due to not knowing where the party is going to be)</p>

        <p>Nano tells Hakase that she's leaving to go to a party, as she leaves, Nakamura pops out once more from the bushes, ready to follow Nano to the party.</p>

        <p>Somewhere not far from Fe-chan's home, Makoto has a huge number of people behind him, ready to party.</p>

        <h4>Act 2</h4>

        <p>Fechan, Weboshi and Misato are still decorating and readying up the party, as they do, someone knocks on the door, that someone being Mai, even though Fe-chan still doesn't have the party ready (And despite her trying to make Mai wait before entering) Mai enters anyways and decides to help them.</p>

        <p>Fechan, Weboshi and Misato (And Mai) have the party ready (Feel free to add a list of the things at the party that can return later for comedic scenes) as they did a few of the people invited enter the party (Mostly Fe-chan's friends from other schools and relatives).</p>

        <p>As Fechan and everyone else at the party are having fun, someone else knocks at the door, Fechan tries to guess who it is (As a little game) but as she opens the door, she doesn't see anyone she knew, aside from the person who made fun of her invitation party paper, Makoto, along with at least 30 people, as Fechan tries not to faint of shock, as she does so, Makoto asks if this is where the party was, after a few exchanges, Fechan is unable to actually say no, so Makoto and his army of troublesome friends enter the party.</p>

        <p>Fechan is scared, she hopes that the new set of strangers don't do anything wrong, so she stares at them intently (Here is a chance to insert a comedic scene of Fechan being over protective of her home and correcting the strangers on every single thing), as Misato wonders if she should try to kick them out, Fechan stops her, thinking that they may hate Fechan if these strangers are from the same school, as Fechan and Misato argue, Misato decides to leave but as soon as she opens the door, Sasahara and his goat are there, causing Misato to go back, grab Fechan and go to the nearest room, various explosions are heard.</p>

        <p>As Nano is walking down the streets, Nakamura is intently hiding behind her, as she does, Nano suffers from a malfunction and shoots a laser that almost kills Nakamura (Cutting a light pole that Nakamura was hiding behind in half), as Nakamura takes a breath, she once again follows Nano, who started running due to not wanting to be found out, the light pole finally falls on the top back of Nakamura's head, making a small crack on Nakamura, Nakamura screams in pain and Nano hears her, but before Nano can actually see her, Nakamura hides again. Nano decides to start running again, and so does Nakamura behind her.</p>

        <p>Jump back to the party, everything is noisy, and Yuuko and Mio are sitting watching the party, as they talk due to being bored, Yuuko asks about the time Mio said she had bad memories of one of the classrooms back when they were trying to help Nano, before Mio can actually explain, she sees outside the window that Sasahara and his goat are there, she quickly tries to hide and is unable to tell Yuuko her explanation.</p>

        <h4>Act 3</h4>
        <p>House is almost completely destroyed, Weboshi, Fe-chan, and Misato all clean up the mess, we get a conclusion of all the characters, end episode</p>
