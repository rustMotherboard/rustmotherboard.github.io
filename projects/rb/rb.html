        <p>ryan brawl is a webcomic based on thebattleryan's 'ryan' species and them competing in something like an object show, as they <i>brawl</i> for a movie. episodes were published onto several discord severs (mostly the tang gang) and members of which were asked to vote between characters</p>

		<p>after episode 3 i think i got too ambitious with how i wanted to do episode 4 and it's been on hiatus since...i think i still have the results for episode 4 though, but i'd need to redo everything i have for episode 4 as i was using an anti-aliased brush for episode 4 and i'd need to change it to be consistent with the other three episodes</p>

		<p><span style="font-size: smaller;">also spencer everly gets made fun of repeatedly in the series - it's a personal beef i have with the guy. long history, it could make a fun blog post though! the dude deleted all their socials anyways ever since they got outed</span></p>
