		<p>PUYOPUNK is a fan-made <abbr title="alternate universe">AU</abbr> of Puyo Puyo revolving around futuristic themes and darker, violent writing. cause i wanted to. it was my first big jump into figuring out digital art ever since mindvisor, and probably one of my favorite works because of the lasting impact, even if it's just a bunch of characters that i screwed up the designs for</p>

		<p>the <abbr title="alternate universe">AU</abbr> would mainly focus with ringo (used to be the protagonist in puyo puyo 7 and i think tetris? it became a lot more ambiguous) as she spirals out of control with herself and eventually gets herself killed, only to be put back together in the far future.</p>

		<h2>key art</h2>
		<p>originally this page hosted the main renders i made for puyopunk, however i've now moved them to puyopunk's category on the <a href="/art.html#ppunk">art page</a>!</p>

		<h2>novel</h2>
		<p>puyopunk also had a novel in development! it was never finished though...but you're free to read it!</p>
