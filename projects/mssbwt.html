        <p>MSSB World Tour (or MWT/MSSBWT, or Microsoft Sam Speaker Box World Tour), is an animated series that i built off of camp entries for the camp The Best of The Best (TBOTB). basically just an older version of <a href="/projects/cfan4.html">CFAN4</a> and <a href="/projects/cfan6.html">CFAN6</a>. not canon anymore</p>
