        <hr>

        <p><abbr title="Nichijou no Gaiden">NNG</abbr> was a web-comic/animation series that i made a while ago. it was one of my first <i>big</i> projects. <abbr title="Nichijou no Gaiden">NNG</abbr> was going to be a mix of the characters from Nichijou with the style of Battle for BFDI, an animated series by jacknjellify, which that kinda styled was used in <a href="/projects/cfan4.html"><abbr title="Camp For Absolutely Nothing 4">CFAN4</abbr></a> and <a href="/projects/cfan6/cfan6.html"><abbr title="Camp For Absolutely Nothing 6">CFAN6</abbr></a> instead.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Nichijou no Gaiden">NNG</abbr> was canceled due to a lack of proper structure, poor planning, mistreatment, and having too much planned at once. it was going to be an animation, then a web-comic, then both, a visual novel was considered, there's a subreddit and wikia page that have been untouched, and two now defunct brand accounts made, being 'team gaiden' and 'taugamma'</p>
        <p>all that currently remains now are the promotional material, scripts, and assets. some webcomic pages were done, but nothing had come out of them!</p>

        <h2>characters</h2>
        <p>these were the original character cards made for the webcomic version of the series, which i think was going to be on <abbr title="MS Paint Fan Adventures">MSPFA</abbr> for some ungodly reason.</p>
