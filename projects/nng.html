        <h1>nichijou no gaiden</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>Nichijou No Gaiden (abbreviated as NNG) was a web-comic/animation series that i made a while ago. it was one of my first <i>big</i> projects. NNG was going to be a mix of the characters from Nichijou with the style of Battle for BFDI, an animated series by jacknjellify, which that kinda styled was used in CFAN4/6 instead.</p>
        <p>NNG was canceled due to a lack of proper structure, poor planning, mistreatment, and having too much planned at once. it was going to be an animation, then a web-comic, then both, a visual novel was considered, there's a subreddit and Wikia page that have been untouched, and two now defunct brand accounts made, being Team Gaiden and Taugamma. </p>
        <p>all that currently remains now are the promotional material, scripts, and assets. Some web-comic pages were done, but nothing had come out of them.</p>

        <h2>characters</h2>
        <p>these were the original character cards made for the webcomic version of the series, which i think was going to be on MSPFA for some ungodly reason.</p>
