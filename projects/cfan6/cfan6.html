        <p>CFAN6 is the sequel to the camp <a href="/projects/cfan4.html">CFAN4</a>, full name being Camp For Absolutely Nothing 4</p>
        <p>object show camps work the same as regular elimination based object shows (akin something such as total drama island). before the camp starts, everyone signs up as their desired contestant, and then they have to make them do the challenges, either the best or funniest entries win. win enough times and you win the camp, after surviving some eliminations and stuff. i haven't done one of these in a while, and i'm not sure if i'll ever get around to doing it again for the desite to work on other projects and stuff</p>
