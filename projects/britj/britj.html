        <p>big rumble in the jumble is a show i put together in about 2 days specifically to just goof off in adobe animate when i don't got anything else going. yeah that's about it. i guess it's kinda inspired by <a href="/projects/cfan6/cfan6.html">cfan6</a> and how that's done... but i think its more so closer to <a href="/projects/rb/rb.html">ryan brawl</a> in its format, honestly</p>
        <p>either way just a really dumb show to fuck around with. don't expect it to be daily...or monthly.</p>
        <p>you <i>can</i> vote, though! if the google form below the episode panel shows you the option to, go for it! you should also be able to vote as much as you want <span style="font-size: x-small;">(as i kinda don't expect any decent audience from this)</span> ... so get voting guys! do it for the new android. do it. do it. do it</p>
