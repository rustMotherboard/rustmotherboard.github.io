        <p>RWWSNC (Reasons Why we Should Never Chart) is a keyboard focused stepmania/etterna pack made by me and charlotte (although as of late it's been mostly my charts). i'm sure you already know what stepmania and etterna are, 4 button arrow rhythm game.</p>

        <h2>song list</h2>
        <p>as of right now the main pack is split into 3 smaller packs</p>
        <ul>
            <li>RWWSNC (the main pack)</li>
            <li>RWWSNC0.5 (charts that sucked so i took them out of the main pack)</li>
            <li>RWWSNC0.6 (dave and bambi related tracks. there were too many)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>as of 10/28/2023 there's 20 + 8 + 8 = 36 total tracks across all three packs. i'm thinking 50 total before release, but if i don't have any good ideas for new songs, i'll just polish it for release.</p>
        <h2>release</h2>
        <p>i'm still working on the pack from time to time, and i'll release it when i think it's all ready for release. the release should ALSO work on quaver, but i haven't tested it</p>

        <p>if i'm lucky it might also release on etternaonline's pack listing, so you'd be able to download it ingame too!</p>
