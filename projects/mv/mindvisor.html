        <p>mindvisor is a yume nikki fan-game about a girl named <b>rikotsura</b>, who receives a prototype for a <b>headset</b> capable of granting users the ability to explore their dreams while conscious, and manipulate them through <b>thoughts</b> alone.</p>

        <p>although exploring your subconscious and reliving memories might seem like a good idea at first, perhaps there are some things which are best left forgotten... or at least things you'd rather not think about.</p>

        <p>the game's still being worked on...no plans to announce a release date</p>
