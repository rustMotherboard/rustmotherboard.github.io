<h1>rikotsura for puyo puyo tetris 2 official part 1: you each get half of a cast</h1>
<h2>10:29 am</h2>
<p>hi all, rust here, and DAMN it appears that i forgot that i was going to go and take my sweet precious time to write a post regarding a new game (and series, maybe, for that matter) that i had recently bought on steam during when christmas sale was still going around and a lot of games became what looked to be dirt cheap! i still got $20 or so left on my steam card <small>(not to mention an extra <b>$50</b> on a visa prepaid that im not sure what the expiry date is on it)</small> but i would assume things are all fine regarding to that! anyways, if you took the time to read the bloody <a href="20-1-27.html">last post</a> you would know that next post was going to be all about puyo puyo. additionally, i am also suffering immensely in science class and i really don't want to fill in on the details. additionally, it's also come to my attention that actually no one looks at my website. i've been rambling on and on for basically no reason now, which is outstanding. pretty demotivating i'll be honest. sorta like the old saying, if a tree falls down and no one's there, did it really fall down? ...actually, i'm not sure if that's the way it goes. look, i don't bloody care. i wanna talk about how lemres taught me the definition of gay, not how my science teacher reminds me of my dad when the dog pisses on the floor. not like it ever ends well. <b>BUuUUuuuuUt</b>, that's a different cookie for a different glass of milk(???). i got a puyo puyo to talk about i hope you like robotnik's mean bean machine (which was our original western version of puyo puyo. why is the western so garbage. holy fuck)</p>
<p class="footnote"><b>further ramblings:</b><br>can i just say this now before io get on with puyo puyo and how much i got into the franchise because of the steam version of puyo puyo tetris? the western's methods of bringing one franchise to another country is DOGSHIT. puyo puyo looks far more interesting than ROBOTNIK'S GREEN BEAN MACHINE. it's generally just legally copying a game and making something new out of it when obviously it's supposed to be something else. note that this was obviously before the mobile market was never original ever since piano tiles 2 started selling out with ED SHEERAN, ugh.<br><br>i'd also like to mention that most puyo puyo games aren't even being localized to the west, which further bothers me. they have an entire mobile game and a 3DS GAME that they thought "NNNNNNAH I DON'T FEEL LIKE BRINGING PUYO PUYO TO THE WEST. WE GOT A MOVIE ABOUT A BLUE FURRY <I>FUCK</I> TO DEAL WITH". alright wew sorry about that i'm just not feelin that well</p>
<h2>10:40 am</h2>
<p>fuck i was just gonna get started with a basic rundown of it. the next subject i have after this is life skills and the next cdli subject isn't until 2 pm during the afternoon. life, why do you have to be such a bitch? anyways yeah sorry for the long and hasty introduction, i actually have to go now for recess, see you at either 12:05 pm, 2 pm, or just not at all for the rest of the day. i really need to start reminding myself to write on time more often. anyways bye i would tell you to stan someone (BUT THAT'S FOR LATER...)</p>
<h2>2:02 pm</h2>
<p>your man's back, and he actually did get on time during 2 pm! absolutely outstanding performance. i got career and i still never got a reply back from one person for an email, so i'm still kinda waiting on that. i wonder what the business day waiting time is for that college's email service. but that's not important, you all know what we're here for in the first place</p>

<p>they told me that <code>marquee</code> was deprecated.... deprecated MY ASS !!!!!!!!!!!!! this is what we call quality content here on the alarmingly official website of rustmotherboard.github.io. only the best content allowed, gamers ONLY!!!!.,.. okay now it's time for the PUYO PUYO moment you've all been waiting for.........</p>
<p>puyo puyo is one of those puzzle games created by a non-western studio meaning it's already less important to the western community than you think it is. some of us have to wait more than a year just for a bloody puzzle game to get localized into another country. life sucks here man i wanna go to japan-okay so puyo puyo is where you match 4 of the same colored blobs or more in good ol' fashioned Doctor Mario Official style up in heres. my magical picture explanation will also explain to you what i mean</p>
<center><img src="../../../images/blog/2020/01/Annotation 2020-01-29 141748.png"></center>
<p>using this example, notice how the orange and purple one's falling down. much like tetris, your piece falls down in a matrix! however, the way you clear them is different. it's also more physics based too actually. okay so it's just doctor mario. IT'S JUST DR. MARIO. <b>IT'S DOCTOR MARIO BUT ANIME I THINK THAT'S WHY I KINDA LIKE IT (NOT TO MENTION IT'S A MORE INTENSE VERSION OF DR. MARIO ANYWAYS) <small>(not that i have a problem with it)</small></b>. but, unlike dr mario, you need to match <i>four</i> in a row (as in, they need to link together in either four directions (no diagonals allowed dunkass)). normally the game is meant to be played with two or more players (yet single player is available (i got max level in it fight me bitch)). you need to create combos n' shit to absolutely PWN your opponent SUPER HARD............. for motivation i recommend you check out this totally unrelated mario kart ds video by your boy <b>supastarrio</b></b></p>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CzReuls6TG8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p>so basically yeah you need to PAAAAAOOOOOWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNNNNN your opponent by creating combos of puyos, so ya need to do some REALLY EPIC STRATEGIC MANEUVERING in order to get that working right, or else they'll send garbage puyos to you instead of vice versa, which is what <i>you</i> want to happen. now, if we were to leave it off as that, it would just sound like dr. mario still, no? THINK AGAIN DUNKASS so turns out since this whole thing came from the epic gamers at japan, they decided "what if we added REALLY COOL ANIME CHARACTERS TO IT???" and after like seven bloody installments where it looked like old anime, they decided to adapt to that new style and all. but first, let's play a quick game of compare and contrast? let's use the epic time travelling machine to look at what the FIRST puyo puyo looked like.</p>
<center><img src="../../../images/blog/2020/01/hqdefault.jpg"></center>
<p>not very visually interesting, is it? yeah i agree. alright look every game's got a first go at it! puyo puyo's no exception. the art style is just reminiscent of the old days of anime with the older designs and general art. it's not very easy to describe what i mean, is it? right, NUMBER TWO AND Onwards started spinning shit around and experimented more. we got to see amazing new characters such as a fish. that's it. alright you know what fuck this i think we're focusing too much on "OH HEY LOOK AT THIS OLD THING BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT THE NEW THING I WAS JUST GONNA SHOW YOU". let's get back on track here. we got the gameplay covered right? match 4 doctor marios and do combos to obliterate your opponents. what makes the game special i believe is because of the CHARACTERS! not the GAMEPLAY (until later)! now, lets ACTUALLY use my epic time travelling idea and go STRAIGHT TO PUYO PUYO BLOODY FUCKING SEVEN! that's right there's seven (AND MORE) puyo puyos it's not like they ever get a break! BUT FIRST <b>SIKE BITCH</b> let's actually go <font size="10">EVEN FATHER BACK IN TIME</font> and introduce you to MADOU MONOGATARI. it was a series of dungeon crawlers that brought you the base characters for puyo puyo (with new ones coming as of puyo puyo seven or some shit idk i'ma not a genius on this stuff). the reason why i'm even bringing this up is because that series... hoo boy that used to be violent. not like, madness combat violent, just that, oh, i don't know, someone loses their bloody focken head. more on that later since NOW, we can move to PP7. this is when we sorta finally get into the modern age with the new style and characters, straying away from the old anime style of things for the characters.</p>
<p>is anything i'm saying make sense at all? what i mean is that the style of the characters, the more interesting part of puyo puyo, started with the classic anime style. after a period of a handful of games, PP7 punches that into the poo dimension and we get the new style... here it is</p>
<center><img src="../../../images/blog/2020/01/maxresdefault.jpg" width="50%"></center>
<p>thereeeeeeeeeee we go. this is where things really start taking shape (i'll also try to make more sense this time around!). notice the new and unique style with the cutscenes being all different. new characters that were included as of this game was... i think the ones in the image (and more)? the left is lemres, the right is klug. additionally, there's more characters too! but for now, this is what i mean by the new art style puyo puyo went for as of the seventh mainline game. HOWEVER, i'm not sure if that whole thing i just said there was TRUE BY ANY CAPACITY, because there was a fuck ton of spinoff and sideline games during these seven mainline titles (which we'll get into one of them later (but you probably already know what that one is.), so the art style could've started in any of those games too.</p>
<p>puyo puyo additionally became more story based during this time! sure, there were cutscenes, but they weren't nearly as eye popping or interesting back on the old limited console days. with the new found graphical powers of rather interesting 2000s hardware, puyo puyo 7 knocked it visually out of the park for the time when it was relevant! we also got to see great characters such as lemres...AND THE FISH AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!! you know, you'll get to see THE FISH AGAIN!!!!!!!! when we get to other titles after! but for now, more on PP7, less on the bloody fucking future that i can't go for one paragraph without saying. why am i so unorganized? alright sorry for rambling on about that, back to dr mario mario seven. to recap, new art style, lemres, and fish. i think puyo puyo cracked the code at this point in it's lineup! it grabs your attention, like a really..uh, sparkly hook! yeah one of those!</p>
<h2>2:50 pm</h2>
<p>oops can't continue about this now i need to go back home soon! when i get back i'll try to better explain this whole thing. i think we sorta just devolved into some unorganized mess with absolutely no sense in it whatsoever. i also kept reiterating the same thing, which i'll stop doing. once i get back, i'll go and recap what all the above even bloody means. peace B) stan [CHARACTER NAME THAT WE'LL <B>GET TO LATER <font size="5">DUNKASS</font></B>)</p>
<h1>30th</h1>
<h2>9:53 am</h2>
<p>hi again it's me rust but you already know that....... last time we finally got to puyo puyo seven and how that changed up the art style for the game, in which i predict was the reason why it got so popular (INSIDE JAPAN BECAUSE THEY NEVER RELEASED IT TO THE WEST HAAAAAHAHAHHHAHHA!!!!). anyways a bit of a recap for ya! puyo puyo is a match 4 puzzle game (similar to tetris) with a focus being on the characters, which had a makeover and overhaul as of at least puyo puyo 7. i mean, look at amitie over here</p>
<center><img src="../../../images/blog/2020/01/image_4.png"><br><small>baby girl that deserves the world</small></center>
<p>they made this game much more precious i'll tell you that one. i think that's also why all the spinoffs exist in the first place! so yeah, we caught up now, we learnt how the funny thing works, you saw the art.... now <b>lets look at those funny characters doe!!!!!!</b> with my magical table skills</p>
<p class="boxed"><b>additional details:</b><br>the art style for the game further developed after puyo puyo seven with spinoffs like.. uh, puyo puyo tetris, which will be our main attraction! yeah that's right they slammed puyo puyo and tetris into one big clusterfuck of a crossover that was not a mistake. additionally, the hamcake was indeed, NOT, a mistake! take that suckers</p>

            <p>the math girl that took arle's place in later games (most of the time), because i'm pretty sure arle decapitating someone's head in the pre-puyo puyo games isn't exactly the best candidate for using dr mario jellybeans from possibly hell. she holds an apple all the time not because she thinks that "EVERYBODY NEEEEEEEEDS IT <SMALL>(heh get it)</SMALL>" but rather because it was a gift from her (currently alive) grandmother that we don't actually know anything about besides the fact that she gave her that apple. i hope she knows that apples don't exactly last forever i mean c'mon ringo it's been a year i know you love your family very much but you should also take into consideration that an apple isn't the most important thing in the world and rather your friends is where it's at. also math</p>

I THINK it was also SCHEZO that literally committed DIRK HEAD MOMENT. like damn you'd think arle would just throw a puyo or something, but NAH, ARLE GUN. ARLE GUN. badass meter off the charts</p>

            <p>yeah see. blame ARLE, who i am now going to call HANK J WIMBLETON from now on. the s stands for winner. also, his last name reminds me of the name "weegee". i sure hope that's fucking coincidental. probably is! by the way i don't think anyone likes schezo so i guess the world was happy for 4 seconds when he committed dirk head. if you read homestuck you'd get what i mean by DIRK HEAD. schezo wants to obtain more power but his lack of using the english language makes him called out for seemingly being some weird creeper person that no one wants to be around and is probably called out on twitter with all his social media accounts mass flagged into submission. his only meaning in life is to suffer to arle.</p>

<p class="boxed">editors note, so it turns out the puyo puyo 7 redesign actually started during puyo puyo fever, in which another publisher/company went and made new characters. thought that would be interesting to know</p>

<p>welp you know what that means......life skills. all i've heard today besides music was the ramblings of my teacher and i've mostly been ignoring the chat for the cdli program. life skills is mediocre usually it's either "we're baking cookies!" or "do my fucking laundry bitch". i should stop being negative though, it's friday and the last day of january! see you at 3 pm and after i finish up my camp entry (which will be our post intermission!)</p>
