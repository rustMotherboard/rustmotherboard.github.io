<p>Hey folks and other weird amalgamations, it's time for another blog post featuring your least favorite person to talk to! Now, I've seen that there's some people who haven't actually saw some of my previous work before, and only know stuff because of my blog.</p>

<p><a title="do the jimbo jambo gym dance loser"><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/02/image_301.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I'll be working on a "projects" page when possible to clear up previous work and such, it'll make things a lot easier.</p>

<p>Anywho, yeah, time for today's topic. Yume Nikki folks, it's a thing! From RPG Maker 2003's best game of the ever, to mediocre Steam remake in Unity or something, Yume Nikki is the game of both worlds, good and bad, VidLii and YouTube (haha get it because YouTube sucks). Anyways yeah the game. Yume Nikki is a game/LSD and acid kind of experience where you're this one girl named Madotsuki (unknown age) who can explore her dreams via this weird ol' room called the Nexus, full of weird doors containing different scenarios.</p>

<p><a title="everyone when the steam remake released to mediocre results"><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/02/image_304.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Upon entering one of those weird funny gamer doors, you'll find random things like a frog, hand with an eye, or some dead guy, and you'll be able to turn them into effects, so if you collected, say, this ol' thing, you would now have the effect called "Severed Head", which makes you, well, a severed head.</p>

<p><a title="&quot;this isn't my house&quot;"><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/02/image_302.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Disturbing, yes. But, a nice little feature. I have no idea if it's just for looks as of yet or if that actually does anything cool but I'd suggest going for the bike upon playing this at first, so that you don't fall asleep during walking through pure nothingness, which is something you'll be experiencing a lot in this, unless you know where to go at any point.</p>

<p>When you collect like, a lot of them, you'll probably find an egg or something. I don't know what the hell you're supposed to do at this point, it gets really confusing. There's more confusing games like this out there though. Speaking of which...</p>

<p>Ever since Yume Nikki existed by a Japanese guy that no one really knows, loadsa other gamers decided "hey that's cool i wanna try that!!!!!!!!!!!". So, they did! And thus, the Yume Nikki Fangame community was born. Rolls right off the tongue like a car with square wheels, huh?</p>

<p><a title="best quality image i could find for this ol' thing, here's today's god of this world"><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/02/image_303.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Anyways yeah, you're a girl who sleeps easily into a room full of doors and you explore them and collect funny things and get all gappled up to have enough effect, drop all of them as eggs in the Nexus, and that's all I know. You also can't leave your house.</p>

<p>Now then, fangames. Loads of em. Words of mine can't describe all of them and their individual qualities that make them unique towards others. One I can name however is the fangame called LCD DEM, which is just LUCID DREAM with some letters missing. Now, what's interesting about this game is actually the guy who made it, his name being Koronba. The guy made hit songs that were really   e p   i   c    such as <a href="https://youtu.be/e_Qb1UP002c">A Sardine Grows From The Soil</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/pskoRCJytR8">that one on my D:\ drive called 0509.mp3/0509.wav</a>, when I somehow found the assets used from Koronba's songs. This included UTAU (vocaloid??) vocals, raw sprites, and all the versions of their songs (instrumental, full, otherwise) in original quality. It was truly something cool to see back then.</p>

<p><a title="literally everyone"><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/02/image_310.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I'm getting sidetracked, though. Anyways, Koronba wasn't too happy of being really cool and popular for some reason, and all the attention made him take the L and freaking die. He ranted about this on his social media (defunct) and insulted the people who shared his work. He also asked people to remove all links to his own LCD DEM game, and not discuss it by any means.</p>

<p>Then everyone made YTPMVs of his songs and LCD DEM is <a href="https://lcddem.fandom.com/wiki/Downloads">still available for download here</a>. Not that respectful, but hey, least we got really nice songs. Sometimes, you have to betray others and make sacrifices. That's how Internet works.</p>

<p>Now, what does dead composers and Yume Nikki have to do with this "klaust_" thing you read from the title? Well... it's none other than my own fangame of course (with art/engine assistance by Sorvete)! That's right gamers............ a fangame by this ding dong with little to no actual good games made under his belt (mainly due to my crappy Scratch games)!</p>

<p>But, instead of some crummy Scratch game again, we're pullin' all the stops. That's right, we're using the engine that started it all, none other than RPG MAKER 2003! Someone out there's gonna be like "VX ACE is better you smelly toe", and to that I say...</p>

<p>uh i dunno lol</p>

<p>Anyways yeah, me and Sorvete's been working on klaust_ for a few weeks since we first started working on it, and progress has been going well! Here's some ingame screenshots.</p>

<p>To the left, you have the protagonist's bedroom, and to the right, the hallway leading to a currently WIP area, none other than the roof! Yeah, that's right. <strong>The roof</strong>. No more balconies! Now you got the entire top of the building as one! Revolutionary!</p>

<p><a title="hallway"><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/02/image_313.png" alt="" /></a>
<a title="room. she has the best game console, don't @ me"><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/02/image_312.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Sorvete designed the backgrounds using Aseprite, and I handed him the drafts I created myself, so we're both doing our own part here. Sort of like how that one saying goes, you can't have one without the other.</p>

<p>I'll be posting updates on this blog and on my Twitter and other social media. For now, I'll share what's already been shared. Anyways, the second and third thing I'll state about this fangame now is the protagonist herself and the game's plot.</p>

<p><a title="original character design"><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/02/image_315.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The protagonist of klaust_ is an 18-year-old (I would've gone for 14 years old but... y'know... r34 artists gonna make everything 40x more awkward.) girl named Riko Asakura. Not to be confused with the Japanese model of the exact same name (which was only a coincidence!). I originally used an .fla which had the original character design that I showed Sorvete in order to actually come up with the character design to be used in-game. The style I went for was much, much different. That's because the original concept for Riko was just an OC since I haven't made a proper one since when I was on Scratch.</p>

<p>You can find the previous design and character information on the <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/ravengenetrix/art/Riko-Asakura-783637828">DeviantArt post</a> for her. I made a new design because the older one was too similar to Madotsuki, even after changing a few things.</p>

<p>The plot for klaust_ is a bit hard to explain on my end, but either way, best not to say how it goes. It'll be different than most, though.</p>

<p>Well, far as I know. Still a tad bit clueless on the existence of some fangames.</p>

<p><a title="klaust_"><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/02/klaustwallpaper.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>klaust<em></strong> - Coming eventually. Expected release during 2019 or 2020 (the roaring twenties!). Check for blog posts with the label "klaust</em>" for information on it alongside updates!</p>

<p>Right, that's all for this post. I believe this should clear up almost everything that's already been told about klaust<em>. And hey, we even got new images from this post as well, so that's a double win situation. Stay tuned for more epic funny haha images and klaust</em> development. Check my Twitter as well, in case if I post something on Twitter and not mention it here.</p>
