        <h1>it's that time of year!</h1>
        <h2>8:48 am</h2>
        a new month has arisen and i forgot to update the blog yesterday! <i>real</i> jolly great. this is FINE. i guess now since this is the month where christmas takes place, i should at least start with something? right, if you read <a href="../11/19-11-27.html">last post</a>, we were <b>JUST</b> about to continue this whole objectbloxia roleplay thing until that "lord of the flies" book decided it was a perfectly acceptable time to exist right now. let me tell you, it was <i>NOT</i> polite of it to just show up and throw my ENTIRE SCHEDULE out the window. that was even some of my longest posts for the month, i was on a <b>ROLL</b> man why did you have to ruin it. oh well, we're gonna watch the movie soon anyways, i'll describe the book after i describe the roleplay. in words. maybe some doodles. why? well, guess what? INTERNET'S DOWN FOR THE MORNING AT THE SCHOOL (AGAIN)! so i can't grab any new images right now until that <b>blasted router</b> wises up. in the meantime, what am i expected to really do without the internet on a <i>school computer</i>? i can't check to see if anyone answered to my email that i haven't even fully finished preparing to get questions on, can't play any of my games (unless you want to see me play solitaire and compare my scores/time per game for some reason with an excel spreadsheet), the only other interesting thing i could do is gander at all of my old work after i do what i'm <i>trying</i> to do, and that being describe that whole objectbloxia roleplay that i was supposed to talk about <big>LAST MONTH</big>. quick rundown of that, it was when i was being the actual effort version decal of marisa from touhou who meets kanna from lucky star (i bet none of you that aren't from r/nichijou heard of that anime alright? (also image not provided due to <b>no internet</b>)) based off of the plot from geibuchan's (probably <i>dead</i>) series, the king's epic adventure (video not provided due to <b>no internet</b>).

        like, i'll be honest. the idea sounds weird, right? touhou and lucky star. <i>well hold your damn HORSE buster</i> because we also decided to include khonjin house and the rust_ lore characters into the mix. YEP THAT INCLUDES <i>AHOXIDE SWORD THING</i>, i bet you <big>ALL</big> remember when i talked about him <code>L A S T  T I M E</code> huh??? well, if you didn't, no worries! he was mentioned in the last post too as i already linked in the first few words of this post. we also somehow included square cirno into the mix, but we'll get to that when we get to it.
        <br>

        the whole thing begins with a newly built bank among the shores of the mainland island before it goes to yoyle city. the building was solid gold seems ike, or just really glossy yellow walls. one of the khonjin house characters, mr moneybags or whatever the fuck, has all of his money in a vault upstairs, er, up<i>truss</i> into the second floor. enter marisa, who's just flying about on her broom and watching some of the non-admins (referred to as just "people" in roleplay form) and trying to figure out what one of those <i>seasons</i> are. she never really did one of those things before where you just constantly travel all around the place and hope you don't get booted off by a "fake and biased" vote from the host, disregarding all of the contestant votes. needless to say the whole thing got boring after a few minutes. only a fwe minutes <i>later</i> did she actually nice the new bank after just going out of the actual mainland area and going to the shore part in-between yoyle city and the.. well, <i>main</i> part of the mainland. she goes into the bank to notice a bunch of lasers guarding the place despite the fact it's the middle of the day. after trying to not get killed by the lasers, she walks to the reception desk to see what in the ever-loving fuck is going on. moneybags appears out of nothingness and says that maris's broom isn't in the budget, despite the fact the broom was always marisa's and never was it part of any sort of budget., u'm pretty sure she made the broom herself. did she? i don't know. im not a god damn genius on touhou lore and i can't search it up anyways <b><i>REMEMBER???</i></b> anyways, after that whole sorta thing, marisa decides to leave before moneybags does anything <i>Not Cool(trademark(copyright(tradecopymarkright)))</i> only to notice that due to the amazing coding of objectbloxia's scripts which are usually just free models customized, it's pitch black outside. pretty dark. enter the two new people, khonjin and.. um.. dime. im not sure if it's dime or football now that were alongside khonjin, but lets just say dime because football is probably in the stupid idiot chamber right now as part of his punishment for <b>blowing up yoyle city that one time</b>. i swear i talked about that whole thing before, but i don't think i can find the post about it. i'll have to talk about it after this. think of this post as a delve into a bunch of objectbloxia and then solitaire. man that'd be a better title than "it's that time of year!", but it's a true enough title so i guess it'll fit <i>for now</i>.
        <br>
        <br>
        khonjin and dime were trying to break into moneybags' bank in order to get all of his cool cash dollars. they were setting up the car for the two to bust in with and then get the money and run like the god damn <b>WIND</b>. however, their plans appeared to be stopped by marisa just when the two started to drive. marisa actually went on the hood of the car while it was driving and said "oh hi!" before the two crashed into a tree. the whole thing collapsed rather hilariously and then set itself on fire. this lead to some sorta... rather nice bonfire! like that one post about <a href="../11/19-11-5.html">a bonfire that <i>i</i> took place in</a>. marisa decided it was perfectly fine to roast a marshmallow under this car heat, probably with an <i>oily</i> smell or whatever to it. wait, wouldn't that cause an explosion? oh well, i suppose that doesn't matter now. anyways, marisa caused the car to crash, so khonjin and dime hopped into a backup one and drove to the bank like they were supposed to do. however, expectantly enough, moneybags had locked the door for obvious reasons. the two found a <i>rather comedic backdoor</i> however and slipped in and went through the lasers to the second floor. marisa followed their footsteps without knowing what they were actually trying to do. once khonjin and dime saw marisa, the two made a break for it. now, we shift focus from <i>those three</i> and now onto kanna, the next important character that'll be important later. i won't say how kanna got here but for <i>now</i> just know that after the events of the king's epic adventure, kanna committed <b>madness combat 11</b> and now has cool blue fire and shit. not sure what would've caused that, but hey that was actually.. um.. <i>my</i> idea. just so you know. haha. right, moving on, kanna broke in the place by <i>also</i> taking the rather comedic backdoor, and she met marisa, who just saw khonjin and dime ran off. kanna mentions that she's here in order to get money for a new DSi since her old one broke. the DSi in this case was one of the important plot points in the king's epic adventure, so she was trying to replace it, obviously. marisa tells kanna that nintendo went and made a DS that goes into the third dimension, and kanna says "wait WHAT? why has no one ever <i>told</i> me about this???"
        <h2>9:42 am (supposedly, the time's like 4 minutes off from the real time)</h2>
        aw man, was just getting to the rather interesting stuff. whatever. after the few hour break i'll tell you all about marisa and kanna's team up cool stuff and khonjin and dime's evil plans to keep the money, while kanna and marisa try to steal it back for the DSi/3DS. i'll tell you now as spoiler-free (no car pun here) as i can. shit. gets. <b>wild</b>. alright see you soon!
        <h2>1:03 pm</h2>
        we're back for an hour! i'll have to be gone for an extra hour or so because i'll be working on a slideshow for the upcoming <i>christmas concert</i>! i won't say of the details until we get further with the concert, and besides, we gotta continue with the whole objectbloxia sorta thing. so, as we left off, marisa says that the DS now comes in several forms, including bigger ones and literally every other system that came after the DS. have you ever heard of the <b>wii</b>? like that one ad where those 2 japanese guys go to people's houses and say "<i>wii</i> would like to play". then the wii u happened. we don't talk about that. least it ran youtube. right, so marisa and kanna become.. friends? i think? i don't think it was very clear, but they teamed up nonetheless. lets go back to khonjin and dime. they're trying to hide the money and try to distract the other 2 or to pick up a fight with them. kanna and marisa first had to detect who exactly did the money stealing originally since they were there after the crime scene. marisa asked one witness who was in the same room as them, but they appeared to be of no help. after busting down the wall (kanna's doing), they come across khonjin and dime trying to get the backup car working again next to the <b>burning remains</b> of the original car that marisa crashed. the four both saw the either groups of two and committed strife against one another. kanna's powers as of the whole king's epic adventure thing gave her powers like the <i>auditor</i> from madness combat, especially in episode 11. a lot of stuff in objectbloxia from me comes from that one episode of madness combat. like, don't ask me <i>why</i> i do that kind of stuff, it's just a sort of habit at this point. that's how <i>ast</i> existed! now, much like previous roleplays, <b>club rust</b> also appeared to be there, which will become an important area later. kanna and marisa chased khonjin and dime to try and stop them, but they were too fast and ran off, even if the other two were flying, giving them the obvious advantage. they go to near the ladder challenge area and think of some plans. kanna, after checking out the entire series of khonjin house <small>(and a tad bit of laughing later)</small>, she suggested that one method for attracting the two, especially khonjin, was to make a pizza. but not like any <b>ORDINARY</b> pizza! let me break it down for you like this. <code>*draws pokemon card out of hand*</code>

        <br>
        there it is. the nasty patty. now, imagine this, but as a pizza. the <b>NASTY PIZZA</b>! made out of only the worst ingredients, it'll kill any khonjin that decides to even take one bite out of it! the <b>DEADLY!</b> attack is something to be worried of, lets be honest. this nasty pizza could kill another nasty pizza if it wanted, but nah, it's ready for some <b>raw. meat. my <big>MAN</big></b>. once the pizza was ready, kanna and marisa set up a quick stand with the pizza and shouted <b>"FREE PIZZA !!! IT's <big>FREEEEEEEEEEEEE</big>-"</b> into a megaphone in order to attract the two. however, back with khonjin and dime, those two had the plan to make DISGUISES! however, since they are GARBO at hiding their true identity, they just put some boxes over their heads. khonjin was trying to be reimu, who, if you remember from that nuclear rp (<b>you don't</b>, just so you know), hasn't returned to either here or gensokoyo (where touhou takes place) since then, which is obviously disappointing for both marisa and cirno (who's.. also been stuck somewhere, we don't quite know where she is right now). oh yeah, and dime's cirno. <i>square</i> cirno. they jumped from the top of club rust, which was where they were scheming the said plan, and walked up to the pizza stand. it appears that the disguises were actually a bunch of <b>garbo</b> and marisa and kanna were able to see right through them. needless to say, after a bit of flying, they ran back to the inside of club rust, in which they started to disassemble some of the screen on the front wall and started throwing it at marisa and kanna (who were following in their footsteps so they could track them down much easier) like khonjin and dime just got out of their whole <b>donkey kong phase kong. dk donkey kong is here kong phase.</b> kanna was able to pin khonjin down while dime was taken care of by marisa, doing the whole bullet hell thing on him. however, after another rust_ lore character got thrown (minigame-o-matic (more on that later, otherwise known as a different time)), marisa decides that <i>she</i> had <big>ENOUGH!</big> it's time for her SPECIAL MOVE, the <b>MASTER SPARK</b>!!!!! otherwise known as the <i>giant fucking laser cannon</i>, which caused some collateral damage to both the club and the bandits. however (YEAH THAT'S RIGHT IT WASN'T OVER !!!!), it turns out that evil bowsur junior had showed up (this would make sense if you read the post that i already linked going to the post from the 27th of last month) and started an <b>e x p l o s i v e  c o u n t d o w n</b> in order to blow club rust up into smithereens. the four were able to escape (besides ast and minigame-o-matic) before the club blew up into smithereens.
        <br>
        <br>
        the aftermath of the club got into ruins, and it also set a bit of the forest ablaze, including the campfire in the forest. kanna and marisa were able to escape to the "edge" of the world, in which the issue with that was that it "<i>didn't render yet</i>". moving on from that, marisa apologized to kanna that she wasn't able to get the money for the new DSi kanna wanted to buy. kanna said to marisa that it wasn't her fault. marisa felt relieved but also asked kanna if they could go to the campfire to sorta explain what happened to, well, kanna. blue fire and all. the last time she asked her about that was when they were back at the bank trying to figure out who exactly stole the money. kanna replied at that time with "it's a long story, but that's not important right now". after some of <i>that</i> discussion, the two head out to the campfire to see it in ruins. they fix it up a little bit so they won't die being there, and decided to hang out at the campfire. this lead to them just, y'know, talking for a bit. khonjin and dime were still out there, <i>whatever</i>, but that wasn't the thing on their minds right now. after some of the discussion, marisa said that she had to go. they each shared text numbers and they parted their ways. <i>until then... to be continued.</i>
        <h2>1:57 pm</h2>
        welp, that ends that sorta large discussion part of the post. next we'll talk about the new characters mentioned here in more detail and whatever else for the rest of the day. it's almost time for me to go for french anyways, so at sometime after 4 pm we'll continue where we left off. ok bye <code>*explodes ok bye !!!!*</code>
