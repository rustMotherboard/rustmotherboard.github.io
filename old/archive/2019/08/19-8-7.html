<p>After finally importing the rest of my Blogspot posts, I'm finally back to making posts on my GitHub Pages site! I feel the need for using Blogger wasn't really needed at all, so I took an hour or so on fixing up this site's obvious errors (as the home shortcut is always on the top of these pages!) and also importing all my old posts from Blogger. This was mainly made to let you guys know that this site is still kicking. No Jekyll, just markdown. I <em>did</em> hear that markdown has custom HTML/CSS support, but until I see marquee's return, I ain't interested.</p>

<p class="boxed"><marquee>editor's note, this</marquee></p>

<p>Marquee was an HTML command that allowed people to make text scroll like a news headline, which I do remember experimenting with way back. However, these sites no longer exist, as they were <code>.html</code> files on my <em>very</em> old laptop.</p>

<p>I have some stuff I want to talk about today, but first, I'm gonna go push all the changes I did with the new blogger import posts. You'll find them <a href="../../../blog.html">here</a>, once they're available. I have 66 files to add in (including this one!).</p>

<p>Give me a moment.</p>

<p>Well, that went way out of hand than I first expected. I actually went and did an entire ROBLOX RP during that 3 hour gap, but there was also some other hotfixes I had to do with the blog. Anyway, time to discuss the stuff I wanted to discuss, starting with the earliest one, that being the parade that I experienced.</p>

<p>Here's the context. My brother came back to my hometown (as of right now) for the annual local event where it's like, a sort of <em>large</em> family reunion. Fun fact, he's into that anime RWBY which I haven't fully gotten into, but <em>will</em> check out one day. I got into a handful of episodes, but I never saw the entire first volume yet. Volumes are like seasons, just named wrong! Back to the event, it's comprised of some events lasting a week or so to welcome the returned family members to our hometown and remind them of our culture. One example of this is, well, the parade! I've seen parades before, and also took part of them! All of them had music in some way, shape or form. This one however, <em>did not</em> have music. To be honest, it was actually really lackluster, and I didn't like the execution. The only notable thing on the parade that I can mention is the Mickey and Minnie Mouse in a canoe sort of thing. I only know more about it than usual because of the recent death of Minnie Mouse's voice actor.</p>

<p>Later on, there were some people dressed as dip and soda brands by taking a large piece of construction paper, stapling it into a tall hoop, and wearing it like a wooden barrel. It's cheap, but it's how we do things. Our hometown is so local, that we barely have a population, let alone a <em>budget</em> to do these sort of things. Even then, our school dwindles on people every year, sometimes including staff. For some, that may be worrying to the future of that building, but for me, that's a <strong>huge</strong> relief.</p>

<p>That's all I could say about that, to be honest. The parade wasn't much at all, and I was just watching it pass my house.</p>

<p>Next on the list, uh... <code>*scavenges through list of topics, with a soda spill*</code>, ah yeah. The group DM I listened to earlier today. My friend Rural thought it was perfectly fine to call everyone in his group DM, and everyone just started talking about Minecraft song parodies. To be honest, I don't really like the Minecraft song parodies that currently exist. There's not very many <em>good</em> ones out there while everyone talks about Revenge and Fallen Kingdom. ~~THE KING ISN'T DEAD~~. Anyways, I decided to make a Watch2gether room so we can watch some Fried Chilli Cheese Dog videos, as everyone started saying quotes from it. Quotes such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"NOW I'M GONNA SMELL LIKE REFRIED BEANSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!"</p>
  
  <p>"i was the adopted one"</p>
  
  <p>"HaVe A bOwL mR sQuIdWaRd!!!1" (We never actually heard this one but I wanted to include it anyways)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The true classics indeed. However, the original channel no longer existed, so people had to reupload all the videos. I miss the channel, and I hope they come back one day. If Madness Combat can have an 11th episode after a much longer wait than BFDIA 6, I feel this wait would be nothing compared to both of those.</p>

<p>Moving on, the Watch2gether room was also made since Rabbit was confirmed to be shutting down as it was a business choice for the site to be pulled down. I'm not sure if it's already down or more officially shut down, but we'll always remember it until a new service sweeps the world Pokemon GO style.</p>

<p>Now, to actually discuss the room! It was a fight between getting Dinosaur Party to play, or an episode of my joke series that combines Khonjin House and RWBY into one. If you remember last year's ultra long post, you would know what I mean by Khonjin House. It eventually lead to another friend of mine, Skaboof, getting RWBY House episode 2 to play in it's entirety, and then Fallen Kingdom played right after. I was able to sneak in the Dinosaur Party video, but it was cut out with a Godzilla shipping video from my other other <em>other</em> friend, Bowtie.</p>

<p>Let me try and slow things down, actually. The group DM began with me checking the group DM in the first place. There were two people named after two villagers in the Minecraft animation Villager News, one being Villager #14, and I forgot the name of the other one. Those two were talking, and then everyone else just started to join in on the group DM, including myself (but I had my mic muted.) After I put on the Watch2gether room, the first thing that started playing was none other than Villager News, staring Villager #14 as the culprit of committing littering, which lead to a high speed chase and a helicopter made out of villagers viewing the chase from a birds eye view.</p>

<p>After roughly half of the episode, it switched to the two Minecraft songs, and then back to Dinosaur Party. I decided that enough was enough, so I put on the next set of videos. I'd like to introduce to you, the SpongeBob SquarePants Vibeo Grame, comes right for the Nintendo Switch. It's a SuperMarioLogan-like video by the channel AquaticNeptune that mostly makes plush videos with a mixture of irony and YTP-like humor. I personally enjoy it more than SuperMarioLogan, and the parodies beat the original.</p>

<p>To be honest, seeing that is a rare case. Either that, or it really depends on the content creator or the person making the parody in the both place. Both of them make an impact to that question on whether or not the parody is <em>actually</em> better than the original.</p>

<p>Here's links to all the aforementioned videos.</p>

<p>After watching the most sad Minecraft animation parody of all time, me and Skaboof decided to watch some videos from a long forgotten age of the YouTubes. Have you ever known about "Roblox Goes Crazy"? It was made by the YouTuber Starman3. However, with the passage of time, Starman3 has been accused of pedophilia recently on Twitter, and his Discord account was suspended by a group of people. You fools, he has <strong>70 ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTS!!</strong> For any further information, Starman3 was accused of actually <em>ten</em> years of pedophilia related acts, and it wasn't just something he randomly started doing. You can thank the SMG4 No Context Twitter account for telling everyone about that with some evidence from Starman3's replies in his YouTube comment sections. That Twitter account likes to complain about SMG4 as much as he posts the actual out of context videos.</p>

<p>At this rate, I'm gonna have to split this into another page to keep up with the times, since once it hits 12:00 AM, it becomes Thursday. I'll see you all in part two in like a bit!</p>
