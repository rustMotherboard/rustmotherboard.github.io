                    <p>inside the contents of the download are a handful of folders, take those and drag them into <code>[install directory]\shimejiee\img</code>. once that's done, run the shimeji-ee <code>.jar</code> file, right click on its icon in the system tray, go to settings -> choose shimeji, and then select the ones you wanna use</p>

                    <p>this is one of the larger parts of the downloads page. what you're seeing here is <b>over 2 GB</b> worth of 600+ projects that were made during my time with the programming site named <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scratch</a>, a visual-based programming language designed for youngins</p>
                    <p>with a clunky graphic editor and some horrible spelling, the scratchxt collection contains some of my first work in the digital space, including some bonus projects!</p>
                    <p>this collection contains three categories, the main projects from the accounts ScratchXT, ScratchXTRises, and ravenGenetrix. the latestremixes folder has the latest remixes of projects (such as ones that encourage adding your OC, have that be remixed, then remix that, etc), and the bonus folder contains misc projects that i thought were funny or some highlights of certain remixes. gifts also fall under this<! /p>
                            <p>(note that you'll need <a href="https://desktop.turbowarp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turbowarp desktop</a> in other to load these projects, a fork of scratch that runs a lot faster than vanilla scratch)</p>
                            <p>it'll take a while to download, so You May Want to Get Some Snacks.</p>

                    <p>download both parts of the archive (<code>.001</code> and <code>.002</code>), then select both, and extract both at once to a folder via 7-zip (should be <code>Extract to "sxtarchive\"</code>)</p>
