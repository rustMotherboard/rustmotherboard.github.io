        <p>hi it's me rust im finally back from coding everything into html files. to be honest i think that took much longer than i wanted it to take. you know how hard it is to convert markdown into html and get it working under a swift period of time!? like <i>dude</i> i had to go through so many recommits in visual studio code to make it the way it is now. at one point the buttons never even showed up and clicking on buttons caused them to open way more than 1 tab because it's in some <code>weird constant loop shit</code>. imagine if you had to convert all of your web page files into some other format just because you wanted the <b>header</b> to look pretty. can't take it man v_v</p>

        <p>i mean just look at these amazing incorrect specimen of what i was trying to do</p>

        <p>jokes aside i think the new theme i came up with looks very nice, not to mention now i can have it look whichever way i want. if you don't like how the site's not wrapped entirely around your browser then go and <i>zoom in</i> i hear that makes things much easier than having to recode everything and/or dealing with userscripts. some of those could even be malicious anyways i mean what else are you gonna expect</p>

        <p>there's a lot of things that happened in-between last blog post and today's blog post. it's been months, but you get the point. fun fact, i actually had to reinstall my entire windows operating system during this time and let me tell you that wasn't fun at all. imagine reinstalling windows because you replaced the memory card in the device manager in hopes of ubuntu noticing that your C:\ drive exists. that's sorta the gitz on what happened that day.</p>

        <h2>10:16 am</h2>
        <p>to begin this story we should also figure out the context of what i was trying to do previously before all this weird reinstalling stuff went down. it all started a few months ago when i was trying to get ubuntu running on my laptop for the third actual attempt. the issue with my laptop is that for some reason it doesn't like it when ubuntu searches for existing drives, so it blocks access to C:\ while ubuntu is located down in E:\, reserved for the USB slot in the drive.</p>
        <h2>12:00 pm</h2>
        <p>forgive me for having shorter text throughout this time, i've been trying to get tidytabs running. it's time for me to finally explain the time i had to totally reinstall windows.</p>

        <p>it all begins when i decided that i should try yet again to install and run ubuntu on my main drive. the issue that happened previously was that the installer could only detect my portable drive that connects via usb into the laptop. that one issue was the sole thing that didn't allow me to even do anything in regards to install ubuntu, so that was it for the day. but THAT NEVER STOPPED <b>ME</b> NOW DID IT. however, that wouldn't be for the better...
        </p>

        <p>me and poke were in a discord group dm while poke was doing some stuff with his own ubuntu/linux distro. i'm pretty sure it was arch linux, in which it's notorious for being one of the hardest distros ever to install due to how much shit you have to do in order to even get it in the installer. at least i was able to <i>get</i> to that step in the installer, thankfully.</p>

        <p>so normally it works when you take the iso file and put it into rufus, a usb flash drive loader. put the iso in the thing and reboot into usb. seems simple enough? most likely not, since it requires <b>SUPER ADVANCED BIOS USAGE</b>. oh my god not the BIOS............. super scary. AH!!! the BIOS is too ADVANCED for me.</p>

        <p>i told poke about the issue, and one of the suggestions that he gave me was something about the memory drive. the memory drive is a drive in the device manager that controls memory, RAM stuff. not the car company but the digital memory sorta thing. note that this was the first time i dealt with this. poke said for me to give it a go. the expectation is that changing the memory drive would've allowed ubuntu to detect the c:\ drive with new memory stuffs. however, it pretty much never worked the way i intended for it to work. y'wanna know what happened?</p>

        <p class="boxed"> UH OH. YOU'VE ENTERED EPIC BOOT LOOP MODE. OH SNAP. OH GOD OH FU</p>
