        <h1>Rust_ Episode 25: Return of the Grammar (ft. Baritone)</h1>
        <h2>1:31 AM</h2>
        <p class="footnote"><b>NOTE:</b> Grammar returns in this post. Who would've known?</p>
        <p>Hi, I'm Rust. Been a while since the last post. I was working on some <i>behind-the-hood</i> stuff, most notably
            the new header, which I've announced before in the previous news ticker below the menu buttons. As the time of
            me writing this, It's 1:32 AM and I'm bored as hell. With the semi-recent introduction of, you know, <i>that</i>
            virus, it's a no-brainer I've had plenty of free time to do whatever. Legend has it that boredom is what can
            sometimes spawn the craziest of posts.</p>
        <p>Besides that, I've generally just been messing about, doing stuff unrelated to this website. For example, I've
            recently gotten back into Tumblr, with my new blog available <a href="https://rustmotherboard.tumblr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. This obviously isn't going to rule out new website
            updates.. I mean, <i>this page exists</i>. That does remind me, I should get around to properly adding stuff to
            my portfolio. It's looking a bit "still not implemented" at the moment, and I should look into that. Website
            shit besides, figured I'd go on about another story (for lack of a better term) for tonight. For the past year,
            I don't exactly remember if I've talked about this before, but I've been on a Minecraft server for a good while
            now. The server's called <b>Pandamium</b> (address <code>pandamium.eu</code>), which is a semi-vanilla server
            mainly focused on the Survival mode. Thankfully, unlike <i>some</i> servers, it's not using any pay-to-win
            methods. Hell, the only donator-only perks you're really getting are faster cooldowns, more <code>/home</code>
            and <code>/rp</code> claims (more chunks included). That and cosmetic stuff, like putting a banner on your head.
        </p>
        <p class="footnote">I had first thought that the whole banner head thing was already a feature in vanilla Minecraft,
            but nope! Turned out to be a server plugin, much like the ability to sit on stairs. Didn't even know that was a
            feature until the time I accidentally right clicked on some stone slabs. More you know, I guess.</p>
        <h2>2:34 AM</h2>
        <p>The server also acts kinda like Hermitcraft, with the inclusion of a shopping district. You can use diamonds (or
            other items) to purchase items like blocks and valuables. You'd think the economy would be fine, but simply
            voting for the server on it's three to four server listings allows you to redeem those votes for diamonds. In
            that case, the economy is not very good, as you can easily get 4 diamonds a day, or even MORE if you have an
            alternate account on hand. You don't even <i>HAVE</i> to be on the server in order for your votes to count! The
            damn thing knows either way. Eventually, you'll have diamonds <b>up the ass</b> and maybe a new rank to go
            alongside it. Ranks also help with <code>/tpa</code> and <code>/home</code> timers, alongside giving you more
            chunk claims.</p>
        <p class="footnote">The <code>/rp</code> command actually stands for <b>RedProtect</b>, yet another server plugin
            that lets you secure your builds from getting tampered with by unwanted visitors <span style="font-size: smaller;">(more on that
                later)</span>. You can set flags on what can be interacted with and even what naturally spawns in the area.
            Said area being created by wrapping the building in a ring of fences and then placing a sign with specific
            terms:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>[rp]</li>
            <li>Name of the claim</li>
            <li>Additional owners</li>
            <li>Also additional owners</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="footnote">You can add additional players by using commands under <code>/rp</code>, but I don't want to
            <i>only</i> talk about what you can do in the server, but rather what <i>I did</i> on the server.
        </p>
        <p>I'd get into how it all began, even after I just described how the server works. However, it's running late for
            me, so I should take some time to rest first before I take the time to tell you all about the experiences with
            Pandamium. See you in a few hours time!</p>
        <h2>11:16 AM</h2>
        <p>Right, where was I? The date was September 13th, 2019. Back when 1.14.4 was still the latest release. Me and
            Sorvete were going through some Minecraft servers to see which one we would make a base on, considering anarchy
            servers sucked and some servers were under the whole "pay-to-win" shtick. After a bit of searching, we came
            across a server that said to work just fine. It was vanilla, had <code>/tpa</code>, in-game economy (which is
            fine for vanilla standards)-ok you know this already it's Pandamium.</p>
        <p class="boxed"><code>

        <p>Sorvete joined the server before I did. We mostly use <code>/msg</code> and <code>/r</code> to chat in DM-like
            fashion, so that no one outside of the group (which was just two people) would eavesdrop our conversation.</p>

            <br>
            [18:51:03]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] i wonder if this server has that one plugin for cutting trees down
            easier. also, yeah?
            <br>
            [18:51:13]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] i should make a realm server sometime instead

            [18:51:37]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] we can probably go fine with the cheapest plan
        </code></p>
        <p>The downside with Realms is that you'll have to pay for the server instead of being freely able to connect to it.
            The upside is that it's easier(?) to invite friends, as long as they're on a legal copy of the game. I've lately

        <p>For a while, we were just doing what Sorvete said! Materials and food. We eventually decided to use baked

        <p>So it turns out doing <code>/ignore all</code> ignores everyone, obviously. Sorvete did the same was having the

        <p><i>Eventually</i>, we get around to more discussion of moving to the new base. Note that at this point, we never
            had a set coordinate to go to. The initial plan was to keep travelling until we find a spot that looked good to
            establish the base. I had a draft of what we were going to do for the top, but I lost the image a while ago.

        <h2>9:25 PM</h2>
        <p>A common thing I like to do when doing inventory management is to take ores and turn them into blocks, which
            (normally) conserves space and allows way more of an ore. Let's do a bit of math to prove this, shouldn't we?
        </p>
        <p>We have 64 stacks of iron ingots. A <b>stack</b> is worth 64 of an item (some can only stack to 16). This equals
            that we have <code>64*64 = 4096</code>. This is way too much for an inventory! However, there's a solution to
            this space problem. You can craft <b>blocks of iron</b> with 9 ingots per block. This means now our total can be
            <code>4096/9 = 455 + 1 (remainder)</code>. This equals 455 blocks + 1 ingot. Dividing 455 by another 64 equals 7
            stacks of iron blocks with 7 iron blocks has a remainder. This means we now only take up 9 slots (8 slots of
            iron blocks, 1 for ingots. A great improvement compared to taking up 64 slots.

        <p>Our portal appeared in an area that seemed to have been tampered by someone else. I don't remember the place (and
            I can't double check for obvious reasons), but the old base is far closer to spawn, which is already closer when
            you're in the Nether due to how travelling works. 1m in the Nether is equivalent to that of 8m in the overworld.
            We come across some interesting stuff in the Nether sooner or later, but that's at the base after this one.</p>

        <p>The plan here was to make a pillar near the Nether portal and provoke a Zombie Pigman (that's what they were
            called at the time). That would allow for the farming of gold nuggets, albeit slowly. The optimal strategy is to
            pillar up two blocks and hit the pigmen with a sword. Rinse and repeat until they stop trying to kill you. I'd
            try doing this method again, but the new mobs are far harder to deal with using this strategy. Some of the mobs,
            for example, the Piglins sometimes have crossbows. Similar to that of the drowned zombies when they're in
            possession of a trident. I swear, their aim is way too fucking precise.</p>

            omnipotent and could watch our every move and ban us on sight for taking items. At the time, we didn't know if
            this server was more lax or more restricted. With my experience of at least two anarchy servers <span style="font-size: smaller;">that
                weren't anarchy because they banned minimaps <span style="font-size: smaller;">BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW IT FUCKING WORKS</span></span>,
            our instincts were to take the items that we find, if any of them were of use. For all we know, the portal could
            lead to absolutely nowhere.</p>

        <p>The base was made in an iceberg biome, with packed ice surrounding a castle-like area, also made in ice. The map
            either showed the spawn or the base, supported by some beams with torches. I located a furnace with 56 coal.
            Besides though, the base seemed to be pretty emptied out. There was nothing else in the area, maybe a few low
            tier items like cobblestone or dirt, but nothing that peaked our interest.</p>

        <p>I don't remember if the food we got there was also either bread or potatoes, but I'll make the guess that it was
            potatoes, since that was what we used to eat for a good while until we eventually switched to cooked cod. We
            managed to get a boat as well, allowing us to travel rather quickly on the ice highway. As some of you may or
            may not know, a boat on ice goes a long way..fastly. Fast, quiclkly, whatever.</p>

            [21:04:45]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] we can go fast now

            [21:05:30]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] food for days
        </code></p>
        <p>We were probably, like, on potatoes or steak or some shit. I don't remember, but I can reassure you that it's not
            that dastardly <i>beetroot</i>. No one likes Beetroot. Back on topic though, we weren't able to find much. Our
            guess was that someone used to have the base, but later abandonded it and left not much behind.</p>

        <p>The bits of map didn't come down because something was catching them before they could fall to the floor. The
            maps were actually on another floor that was barely even a floor. I remember it just being a staircase that goes
            to the wall that has the map. Of the base.</p>
        <h2>2:18 AM</h2>
        <p>Sometime after that, we went back to the overworld, either at the temporary base for supplies or we actually

        <p>Gonna leave it at that for tonight, actually. It's getting pretty late for blog writing. I'll sleep for a few

        <p>Do pardon, I've been actually adding some new <i>advertisement buttons</i> to the index! Not to worry, they're
            not the actual banner ads that get stabbed to death by my adblocker. It's actually those 88x31px images that you
            put on to advertise your friends sites, much to that of the olden internet days. Funnily enough, every site I've
            put on there so far are hosted by Neocities in one way or another. I'm out here using GitHub and you DINGUSES
            are still suffering to 1 GB limits?? <b>CRINGE</b>. I'll continue once I think I put enough buttons on there.

        <p>Finally, the interesting part. After exploring and taking some coal from the Cirno base (that of which probably

            blocks. Maybe even ten thousand, although I don't even pay attention to the current coordinates nowadays, so

        <p>Ah, yes. The Book of Doremy. The hit novel that shook Pandamium on the very server plugins that keep it running.
            The sheer existence of this few page (or one page) wonder was something to behold. I don't remember the text of
            it, but it was about Doremy and Touhou...and also about klaust_ because <i>WHY NOT AM I RIGHT???</i> Sadly, if
            you go to the temporary base now, the book appears to have been misplaced, destroyed maybe. Wherever the book is
            now, I dearly hope it is in good hands. God, if they put a price on it, I swear to <code>humanity's realm</code>
            that I'm taking that book back either way. Buying it or not. That shit's ours.</p>

            didn't have any leashes. To be honest, I have doubts leashes would even work, but I haven't tested that for
            myself. Wouldn't bother checking to find out, though.</p>

        <p>Do pardon for my lack of in-game imagery. I never took any screenshots until the 26th. These logs take place on
            the 13th. I'll have to explain this next one with my <b>ELITE NARRATIVE SKILLS</b>. <br>After checking out the
            turtles near the shore of a beach (or snowy beach, can't remember), we come across a rather peculiar mob
            grinder. Not a modern design, but rather the old fashioned one, carved out of cobble..or stone. Cobblestone. The
            model where mobs spawn based on darkness, and fall into trap doors into a singular spot. The grinder appeared to
            be in semi-working condition. It was night, though. Mobs were spawning around the grinder, which hindered
            performance to some extent to the point where it was noticeable.</p>
        <p class="boxed"><code>

            [22:25:46]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] all that's here though is a bow

            [22:26:16]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] prob not
        </code></p>
        <p>We did find a boat at the grinder, though. That's yet another boat that hasn't been unloaded by the server for
            doing nothing significant at all. Eventually, we got to 6k blocks out. In the opposite direction. Our initial
            plans were to go north, which is -X according to XYZ coordinates. +X is south, in that case. I think. I don't
            remember clearly.</p>
        <p class="boxed"><code>
            [22:29:41]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] we're at -6k out

            <br>
            [22:30:01]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] eh, it's still 6k out
            <br>
            [22:30:16]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] plus it's north according to my minimap

        <p><span style="font-size: smaller;">(MINIMAP GANG 4 LYFE!!!!)</span></p>
        <p>After realizing coordinates, we came across yet another place not too far away from the mob grinder. At first, we
            thought it was a normal, auto-generated village. Despite our guess, this actually came out to be a roleplay
            village with custom made buildings, and, if I'm correct, a board that states rules. Much like everything else
            we've gone through as of the adventure, it was a ghost town with no one but ourselves near the seemingly empty
            places. Kind of creeps you out, you know? There used to be people working on this, but they left. It gets you
            thinking on whatever happened. This did not cross my mind however, as I was more concerned on the fact that this
            is a roleplay village. For a bonus, if that argument from earlier wasn't enough, a bot also joined the server
            and spammed a server IP to a probably now defunct anarchy server.</p>

        <p>In a shocking twist of events, it appeared that someone (or a group) fled a bunch of bots to the Pandamium server
            in the hopes of the server crashing due to an overload of players. However, the bots appeared to have left on
            their own terms (or they got banned, not sure). This was the only time I remember this happening during my time
            on the server. There was also a time where SalC1 was rumored to have joined the server, but I never witnessed
            that myself. For the rest of time, I am to believe <i>that</i> is an urban legend, whether or not if it's true
            is something we may never know. I wonder how SocialMinecraft.com is doing considering all of this. Probably
            banned minimaps or some shit. That and someone duped it to death. Some people do that on pay to win servers,
            it's actually more of a heroic act in that case.</p>
        <p class="footnote">FOOTNOTE: Pay to win servers are like those mobile subscriptions on apps. It's like a normal
            server, but you can instantly gain better perks, unfair advantages, AND enchanted kits if you cough up a couple
            of bucks. Why bother actually earning the resources when you can just buy a rank so that you can get the ability
            to fly and have OP armor compared to everyone else who actually has to <i>try</i> to get the items? In this
            case, exploiting the server with duplicate glitches is the best way to handle them. If they won't go by the
            terms of service with Mojang (aka "no u cant just sell ingame items for real money it's not allowed u cant do
            that"), you might as well take matter into your own hands and <b>bash them into the fucking ground like the
                <i>runts</i> that they are.</b></p>

        <h2>1:30 PM</h2>
        <p>When You JOIN &quot;SocialMinecraft com&quot; NOW! Epic Style. Anyways, we're back! Last time, we ended up in a
            roleplay village. We also found an unrelated skeleton horse. I'm pretty sure those only spawn with a skeleton,
            so the skeleton might have burnt from the daylight.</p>
        <p class="boxed"><code>

        </code></p>
        <p>I later found some skeleton horses at the new base we eventually built, but they all fucked off in a matter of
            months.</p>
        <p class="boxed"><code>

        <p>Do let me remind you that we're 6 to 7k blocks away from base, but we're moving away from it, so does it
            technically count? Probably. You know, until we come across an ocean. I eventually tame the horse, thankfully.
        </p>
        <p class="boxed"><code>

        </code></p>
        <p>Some time later (aka like 40 bloody seconds), we actually came across an area that was protected with RedProtect,
            something we haven't seen before. The region was called "Mendilson", owned by <b>lavabubba</b> and
            <b>raindeeryt</b>. By the sound of the last name, a YouTuber with 12 or less subscribers seemed to have
            constructed this place with one of their friends. I don't have any screenshots of this either, and I'm also
            starting to think that the logs here are getting repetitive, <i>especially</i> when SocialMinecraft.com decided
            to take a visit to the server.
        </p>
        <p class="boxed"><code>
            [22:39:23]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] looks like this is an actual place
        </code></p>
        <p>A relog later considering I was worried about the skeleton horse, and it turned out that the server hid the horse
            from me and I had to relog in order for it to reload properly so I could interact with it. In short, "horse go
            missing because server fucked up". Mandilson appeared to be a <i>generated</i> village with some additional
            stuff added around with all the (good) resources gutted out.</p>
        <p class="boxed"><code>
            [22:42:22]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] seems like this village might've already been used
        </code></p>
        <p>Then, my music player decided "hmm today i will put on some fast paced music", which really drove me off the wall
            since I was wanting to travel fast. Note we do not have elytras yet, so we have to go on foot. Coincidentally,
            we also appeared to come across a frozen river. <b>AND</b>, if you remember, boats on ice like to go fast
            because of the physics engine.</p>

        <p>As if the coral weren't enough, we also came across an ocean monument. I have some beef to pick with those.</p>
        <table class="borderless">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>Alright, so guardians are these large fish looking things that wander around the monument. You know
                        what
                        I hate about them? Just, them. Their attacks. For one, they charge up this laser and deal some
                        medium
                        damage. While this is fine on it's own, imagine multiplying that by twelve times. The lasers are
                        hard to
                        pick out when there's so fucking many of them to the point where your screen is ONLY the lasers. I
                        can't
                        even see where I'm going sometimes because I'm trying to kill an Elder Guardian before I have to get
                        another 3 minutes of mining fatigue. The Elder Guardian gets a special <i>"fuck you"</i> from me
                        personally. It's the same mob as the regular guardian, although NOW they can jumpscare you and give
                        you
                        a fuck ton of mining fatigue. You better hope to the dream lands that you have a bucket of milk on
                        you
                        in order to get rid of the status effects or things won't be out in your favor for far long than
                        they
                        should be. Once you get a hold of them, they're great EXP and food resources. Especially if you
                        transformed the monument into a farm. Thankfully, RedProtect allows you to disable spawning hostile
                        mobs, which we didn't realize until we had already done a good bulk of the job clearing it out to
                        begin
                        with. Getting the Elder Guardians killed <i>alone</i> killed me and InfinitySnapz (sorvete wasn't on
                        for
                        a while at the time so i invited infinity over) way too many times for me to be proud of.</p>

        <p>I say that's enough beef for this upd9. After somehow crossing the monument unharmed, it only took a minute or
            three until we came across a shipwreck. If we're lucky, we could get some decent items in those. </p>

        <p>I honestly can't figure out the context of the rest of this, but I assume Sorvete travelled much farther than I

        <p>A bit of silent travelling for a few minutes later with little to no public interferrence or anything

            [23:44:53]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] specific biome could be mesa or extreme stone hills

        <p>It didn't take long for us to locate the biome, only took a minute. Surprisingly, we're almost done with the logs

            only covers the entire day from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59, to which after it hits 24:00:00, that's technically a new
            day. In that case, the log gets split per day. The rest of this log is much shorter, though. Anyways, we

        <p>The rest of the log has no conversations after that. I assume we talked the rest of the plans on Discord and went
            to sleep. That concludes that session, actually! Took a bit to get there, but I finally pulled through. At least
            I was more competent to finish one chunk of it. After all, we still have a ways to go.</p>

        <p>That does mean I'll have to warrant a part 2 post sometime soon, but I'd rather keep content diverse and not have
            it be all Minecraft for the next few months. That concludes this post! Part 2 is.. somewhere. I don't know. If I
            was able to discuss an entire game's plot line, this is <b>nothing</b>.</p>
