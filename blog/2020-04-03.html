        <h1>rikotsura for puyo puyo tetris 2 official part 3: THEY SEE ME ROLLIN'. THEY HATIN'.</h1>
        <h2>3:56 pm</h2>
        <p>before we get all puyo puyo up in here be sure to read <a href="2020-01-29.html">parts 1</a> and <a href="2020-02-03.html">part 2 before you go and start reading this one. the plot in this one goes off the bloody walls so i'd recommend that you get to work on reading those two long posts before getting to this one, which by all means will most likely be shorter than all the other ones.</a> shut up</p>
        <h2>7:45 pm</h2>
        <p><b>TO RECAP:</b> i was talking about the plot of puyo puyo tetris as part of the. really, really, really, REALLY big review. we left off on act six where the ss tetra gang and other people from puyo puyo duke it out using DREAMS. people that don't actually exist. the teacher built the, er, stadium type thing. with what, cardboard? that's not exactly stated though. imagine if it were.</p>
        <h3>act six part two: i hate this act</h3>
        <p>let's SPEED THINGS UP. this act is BORING AS FUCK !</p>
        <p><b>RINGO</b>: ringo, the ghostphobic (fear of ghosts), goes against the TWO GHOSTS !!!!!!! yu and rei. they're GHOSTS because they got browned in TROC 6 i mean they UH DIED. nice going ringo you STUPID FUCK you literally did that thing where you jinxed yourself yeah nice going. yu says that her and rei have a SPECIAL DELIVERY. a DELIVERY from the GHOST OFFICE. oh boy i wonder what this could mean?!??????!?? ringo literally does not want to hear it and wants the ghosts to go away because they're illogical. okay explain that fucking fish. maguro and the bear guy named risukuma or whatever instead take the place of the ghosts so that ringo doesn't implode from the fear of dead beings that are not dead. ringo and maguro do that thing where the battle with the puyo puyo blobs or some shit i don't know i never played the game (OH WAIT. I <B>DID</B> PLAY THE GAME). also the bear guy is accused of POSSIBLY, just <i>POSSIBLY</i> being a costume. but like the fate of this franchise.. yeah good luck answering that lmao</p>
        <p><b>AMITIE</b>: amitie meets lidelle as part of the thing in where they do the fight in the stadium. there's also raffina (the kung fu gal who's the rival, as of puyo puyo fever.. uh, like, one or two or something), klug (smartass), feli (goth girl...okay she's cool), lemres (KINDA AMAZING, actually.), and last but MOST IMPORTANTLY <span style="font-size: smaller;">WAIT WHAT DO YOU MEAN LEMRES ISN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT WHAT OKAY EXCUSE ME</span>, sig! !!!!!!!!!! you know, the BUG PERSON with the RED ARM from DOOM ETERNAL AND OR MADNESS COMBAT EPISODES NINE THROUGH ELEVEN (only people get the joke!). amitie tells the illusion of sig that he's an illusion. sig says that's a bummer. that's a bummer. amitie says that it's all confusing. yeah just like this game'S STUPID FUCKING PLOT!................... god this is <b>FULL OF PLOTHOLES</b>, way more than even a <i>construction site</i>, but i'm getting sidetracked here. the two fight and amitie wins (UNSURPRISINGLY), she flexes in her new strength. yeah that's what she does. she flexes. SHE FLEXES. and for the sigami fans out there I GOT YA' COVERED okay !?!???? amitie mentions to the illusion sig that she had always wanted to tell sig something for a while now. however, the illusion says to tell the REAL sig. man, i wonder what that could mean. oh by the way i love amitie okay thanks for coming to my ted talk <span style="font-size: smaller;">BUT I'M NOT DONE YET</span></p>
        <p><b>TEE</b>: jay and elle, the TROUBLEMAKING.. ER, DUO. they're the one's in tee's memories. they conduct a master plan to try and mess with his brain with the following logic. if the area is constructed to withheld the memories, would tampering with the building also tamper with the memories of the people (or person) involved? are the duo trying to kill tee at this rate by making him forget how to breathe? are these pranks or assassination attempts gone wrong? however, before tee could die by lack of brain, he stops the duo before they do anything. also ai (aka the dog (literally!)) shows up, nervous about the dream world place thing being "rather unstable". well there's chunks of it literally flying about i would assume that means it's unstable as an active volcano? whatever. tee tells the illusion of ai to go while the twins. uh, i don't know. they sorta just fade out or something like mario when he do the thing where he jump through the wall into the. bob-bob bobblefield.</p>
        <h1>4th</h1>
        <h2>2:45 pm</h2>
        <h3>act six part three: almost there don't worry.</h3>
        <p><b>TEE (CONTINUED)</b>: tee wonders if he'll meet the tetris king before him as his opponent as tee had fond memories of him. HMM. i wonder who this could relate to. instead, o shows up and fights tee instead. after the BATTLE, tee wonders where his logs actually go and who listens to them. might be my voice mail i don't know</p>
        <p><b>ESS</b>: ess fights zed aka the FAKE FATHER FIGURE, and throws anyone out the window who says that robots aren't supposed to be fathers of living, breathing human people. however, the illusion of zed breaks the, er, mold, by saying that he's just a guardian, not a father. i believe this may be the actual father speaking through the illusion of zed stating that he's sorry he wasn't able to be there with ess. ess doesn't understand and just wants to do a tetris battle with papa like old times. one battle later and the illusion disappears, while ess doesn't understand what the bloody hell that means and then concludes that wasn't the real papa, so ess just goes to find the real one. if only she had the prior knowledge...</p>
        <p><b>O</b>: o has a fucking panic attack.. because he meets SOMEONE DIFFERENT wait WHAT?????? someone <b>DIFFERENT</b> yeah that's BLOODY FUCKIN' RIGHT. it turns out we were missing someone the whole time. this guy is what we like to call the man behind the slaughter I MEAN the man behind the listening to tee's reports. however, despite this, this mysterious man that knows O and recieves the reports... this.. THIS <I>IS</I> THE MAN BEHIND THE SLAUGHTER.</p>
        <p class="center"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2020/04/image_44.png"></p>
        <p>this is ex, the former tetris king that also gets tee's reports and also just fucking caused the plot of the game. anywho yeah the illusion of ex says to come to where the REAL ex is and stop him from doing anything else before he makes the game an epic games exclusive for a year or two. ex is located at the farthest edges of spacetime (space and time but as one word). ex then runs off, leaving o to just go like. ok bro what the FLIP, FRICK, AND FUCK.</p>
        <p>the poo gang finally make it back to the. uh. school place. yeah yknow that funny place! the thing where the stuff happens. now everyone's like super cool and strong now after facing just mere illusions. while everyone's all like. cool and stuff (remember the fact that amitie flexed), ess is worried about her papa and tee recommends amitie to give her some alone time after when she was trying to make sure if she was feeling alright. tee and amitie then discuss the feelings of being alone. tee states that once this whole mess is resolved, they're gonna have to split up and stuff and like that sucks. amitie is equally distressed. blah blah blah the teacher/cat duo restates the bloody mission this is getting boring MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ACT.</p>
        <h3>act seven: THE FINALLY</h3>

        </p>
        <p>A young woman stands in her bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 30th of July, 2009, is this young woman's birthday. Though it was sixteen years ago he was given life, she already has been given a name!</p>
        <p>Your name is RINGO. As was previously mentioned it is your BIRTHDAY. A number of GIFTS are scattered about your room. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for SINGING IMPROVISED LYRICS. You like to use magic but you are NOT VERY GOOD AT IT. You have a fondness for BEING DOWN-TO-EARTH, and are an aspiring GREENGROCER. You also like to pop PUYOS sometimes.</p>
        <p>What will you do?</p>
        <p>wait a minute that's not right. ah here it is, the ACTUAL FINALE.</p>
        <h3>act seven: THE FINALLY, FOR REAL THIS TIMEALLY</h3>
        <p>the fucks make it to THE EDGE OF SPACETIME, where all the weird roads and squiggly lines live. ringo mentions where the "Keeper" could be.. enter Ex. yep that's right it was him all along that DUMB FUCK!!! it just so happens that EX is the one who's the role of keeper of dimensions, which i'd argue is far more important than just a mere TETRIS KING. we can FINALLY fucking cross him off the list.</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strike>ess</strike></li>
            <li><strike>ai</strike></li>
            <li><strike>jay and elle (they're twins they always stick together!)</strike></li>
            <li><strike>zed</strike></li>
            <li><strike>..uhhh, someone else? nah i'm sure that covers all the missing ones. FOR NOW..........</strike></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>everyone tells ex that while the new friends were worthwhile the whole experience was just a mere mess. ess states this with extra harshness and emphasis. note that ess also doesn't remember that ex is the true father. ex however just runs off because he can't do the situation on his own despite the fact that yknow it's kinda his problem. oh and puyos and tetriminoes come after them and they yknow do the thing where they clear and/or pop them. they return to ex, which offers the gang to follow him. ex tells the poo gang a Very Sad And Story.</p>
        <p>when ex was the former tetris king (which is now belonging to tee), ex learnt that he has the power to cross between worlds (or dimensions, same thing), hence his new title being the keeper of dimensions. however, the man spent his days being alone, with the only companionship being the logs that tee says to O, which is relayed to ex, somehow. ex found the universe watching thing to be all boring and uninteresting to him. however, before he could say what happened next, the guy just RUNS OFF AGAIN. like damn he just. <b>Goes</b> with no further information. however, before arle and o could have another 5 minute conversation about ex's loneliness, more of the tetriminos and puyos and salt and pepper and lego bricks and nails come straight towards them.</p>
        <p><b>ONE CLEARING SESSION AKA BATTLE PERHAPS MAYBE LATER:</b></p>
        <p>they meet ex again, but he runs off.</p>
        <p><b>ONE CHASE LATER:</b></p>
        <p>ex continues his story that he was being alone. he was sad that he was, well, alone. ess then just says it's his job. okay ess shut the fuck up forever now thanks even if people have jobs they have BLOODY FEELINGS. ess literally has no compassion or respect for anyone besides that fucking CLEANING ROBOT. ex also runs off lmao</p>
        <p><b>YEAH SO THEY'RE JUST CLEARING DEBRIS WHILE LISTENING TO HIS BLOODY SOB FEST OF A STORY SO JUST KEEP MOVING...LATER:</b></p>
        <p>so ex continues his story about fucking it up and causing a tear between the two dimensions. ex tried patching it up but he was too late to do anything about it before it y'know became a rather big deal. he was also too depressed to even bother. ringo realizes that, even if tee knows ex, he's not really relating to it and has been quiet. tee says that it's fine but yknow debris shit okay okay uh</p>
        <p><B>ONE:</B></p>
        <p>tee decides to continue going through the debris in order to overtake ex, but ringo's tryna ASK TEE THE QUESTION. the question, to master ALL QUESTIONS. man i sure hope it isn't what 2+2 is that question's IMPOSSIBLE!!!</p>
        <p>finally, after all these months... we made it. THE DOOR, THAT'S BETWEEN TETRIS LAND AND PUYO LAND. this is what connects the dimensions together. ex literally just STARES AT THIS FUCKING DOOR. ex tells tee that he needs to fight him and win so that ex can learn of why his job is important. there's an obvious solution to this and it's JUST TO LEARN THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. <B>GOD</B>, THE NAME <I>ALONE</I> SHOULD TELL YOU WHY IT'S AN IMPORTANT JOB. YOU'RE KEEPING TWO DIMENSIONS FROM SMASHING INTO ONE ANOTHER AND YOU DON'T THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS SINCE THE INVENTORS OF FUCKING <B>BREAD</B>. tee agrees to ex's demands and the two battle, king vs keeper. have we done it? is the problem no more? well we're 7 minutes into 20 minutes so uhh yeah lol no. even if the minos and puyos are gone now, tee has his own offer in mind with ex. swap places, keeper and king. yeah that's right tee wants to have the worst job ever over having a fucking starship. understandably, literally everyone just says "seriously?!" because tee is not fucking helping. you bumbling baboon. ringo's skeptical about it, and ess is just bawling about it because she hasn't had enough to complain about today.</p>
        <p>tee's excuse is that he doesn't want ex to be lonely, and that if he could do it, so could tee. ess calls tee out for being fucking insane. obviously everyone else tells tee that if he were to swap jobs with ex, tee would be the one that's stuck alone listening to reports as the only form of human interaction he'll get for the rest of his days. ex allows the deal, but tee decides on something. if tee wins against a fight against ex, then they get to swap places. otherwise, they, er, don't. tee you fucking DOLT. you absolute MORON. IDIOT. dumb FUCK. you don't know what's gonn' go and happen if you even ATTEMPT at doing this job. however, they ain't holdin back. this is where the REAL fight happens, y'see</p>
        <p><b>Ex</b>: Brace yourself, Tee.</p>
        <p><b>ONE SUPER DUPER WOW WOW OVER THE TOP SUPER VERY COOL EPIC BATTLE LATER:</b></p>
        <p>tee won lmao, so the job role switch thing is about be taken in place. however, before tee could fully claim his position, ringo steps up for ex and everyone else because she. has HAD. E<b>NOUGH</b> of this FUCKING <B>BULLSHIT</B>. she is <span style="font-size: larger;">PISSED OFF</span>. THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION, TEE. YOU FUCKING FUCK, YOU BUMBLING DOLT, YOU MADMAN, YOU PSYCHOPATH, YOU PIZZA SHIT. ess was right, tee <i>IS</i> an insane lunatic!!!!!!!! however tee does not fully comprehend the reason why his stupid solution would do anything good. if anything, he'll fuck it up and get depressed and shit. ringo, however, has the PERFECT idea to make tee understand. KNOCK SOME FUCKING SENSE INTO HIS WALNUT-SIZED BRAIN. they're going to use FUSION MODE. oh SHIT. tee's not gonna get out of this one he finna end up like hank j wimbleton</p>
        <p><b>ONE PUNCHING TEE IN THE MOUTH LATER:</b></p>
        <p>ringo won lmao. ex states that the keeper of dimensions isn't allowed to leave the door zone. ever. like, never ever. that means he can't make plans to do anything elsewhere because then there'd be no keeper. at the door. the dumb fucks gang appear to have run into a brick wall with their drawing board on how to make sure ex and tee aren't a bunch of lonely depressed inanimate insanity suitcases. however, ex disproves the whole thing by saying it's hopeless and the keeper's do what he gotta do. HOWEVERBUTTHENSUDDENLY, another voice appears. DARK PRINCE AKA SATAN. YEAH SEE HE'S KINDA BE BACK DOE. ecolo has ALSO returned, because he has the power to yknow cross dimensions. it turns out ecolo and dark prince made a WARP TUNNEL from the ss tetra to the door zone. arle's happy about this, and satan witnesses the smile. he may never wash his eyes after this. ringo thanks ecolo, to which ecolo says if he could get more than a smile. ecolo are you trying to get head you poo face. dark prince says to not get needy, with ecolo questioning his advice in general from a person like him. ex then says he's very happy and thanks everyone for what they've done just so they can make HIM not lonely. however, now he gotta do that thing where he FIX THE DUMB BOUNDARIES DOE. however, this does mean...</p>
        <p>they gotta go.</p>
        <p>the ss tetra and the primp town peoples all say their well-constructed goodbyes to one another. they won't be able to see each other again. arle asks ringo on whether or not she's sad that they're leaving, to which ringo says not, since they're most likely going to meet each other sooner or later because of warping mishaps or something along those lines. however, before anything else, ringo gives tee a gift. her fruit from her own house. arle recommends that tee goes after ringo as she gets her fruit.</p>
        <p>ringo shows tee.........the <b>Apple</b>. as stated, the best fruit ever. ringo also gives tee marshmallows, which should remind him of puyos. alright but now it's time for their goodbyes. tee hates them, since he doesn't know what to say before he leaves. ringo relates to it, also showing a depressed expression. they then say to just, y'know, not say it. ringo just wants to remember these final times with a smile. tee gets hit close to home about this and gets emotional, to ringo's surprise. she then proceeds to imitate tee about him tryna be all COOL and being the tetris king. the two laugh it off, signaling that promise they just made a bloody minute ago. arle and amitie also show up and comment about ringo's seriousness during the battle, to her surprise. they all have fun, as their last memory. they'll never forget each other as part of their departure.</p>
