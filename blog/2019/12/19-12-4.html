        <p>hi it's me rust im watching touhou characters play slender, the game where y'gotta find those <b>8 rather comedic pages</b> before the guy with the extra arms (i am VERY JEALOUS!!!!!!!!!!!) gets you in a very mediocre game of hide and seek. look if i wanna play something scary i'd play <i>mineshaftcrapcraft</i>, the <big>ULTIMATE</big> fitness training program that anyone can play. steering wheel controller supported too. that's a thing. yes. <i>i saw it happen</i>. i just wrote that whole chunk of text under the footer. damn, and i haven't even been drinking <b>nonalcoholic drinks</b> as of, well, <i>ever</i>. like i'll be real here how come you can feel the same as drunk but not really with different drinks? i don't understand man, i just don't recall. anyways, if you're not <b>somewhat blind</b>, you would know that im talking about my visa gift card today and then the stuff i was gonna talk about <a href="19-12-2.html">2 days ago</a> from now, that of which due to me being <b>horrendously lazy</b>. half of the time was me doing nothing and also working on some project before i go deal with math again, so i haven't been able to type little to anything for the past hour on this post. <i>so...</i> um. have this for the next hour or so before social studies starts up after recess! reimu and marisa on the laptop, what r they doing ?????????? <b>YOU</b> tell <b>ME</b>!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
        <center><img class="figure" src="/img/blog/2019/12/them.png"></center>
        <h2>9:40 am</h2>
        and there's the time. off i go! then we talk visa gift cards at 11:00 am or some shit.
        <h2>11:09 am</h2>
        <p class="footnote">footnote: at this point, i'm finally using the <code>p</code> tag in order to have paragraphs, and not using the <code>br</code> tag constantly. that's gonna save me some lines i'll be honest with you there.</p>
        <p class="boxed">update: everything has the p tag now B)</p>
        <p>i have returned! turns out i was having french, not math. man am i even <i>blinder</i> or what?! well, let's just begin with the current topic before we continue with the one from last post. cut to a week or two ago, i remembered that my spongebob reusable bank (yes, i have one of those. <b>yes, it exists</b>.) actually existed with money in it, with around $220 dollars (IN DOLLAR BILLS ALONE) worth in money, and that the <i>post office</i> in my town might, <big>MIGHT</big> include some gift cards that i always thought i could only get by ordering them online or going all the way to walmart (2 day trip (sometimes more)), the other option to be just being lucky in a school draw, but the only interesting ones that the school <i>does</i> have is just one of those itunes gift cards. but hey, i can buy <i>robux</i> with that type of money, so i'll give it a pass! anyways, after i recounted all of the money, put it in my wallet, and head out to the post office after around 12 minutes of walking from home to the other building. once i arrived, i decided to order a $60 visa, paid the (small) fee, got the card, and went back home. this allowed me to scratch off a <i>lot</i> of games originally on my wishlist. those being:
            <ul>
                <li>portal (bundled)</li>
                <li>portal 2 (bundled)</li>
                <li>bejeweled 3</li>
                <li>ballisticng soundtrack</li>
                <li>baba is you</li>
                <li>marble it up</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>one of those aren't even a game, but it's not like that really matters because i want to support vonsnake with his game anyways! you know, i would've expected this whole thing to last a bit longer on how i actually got the visa, but it appears i was able to explain it in less then two parts this time. <i>w o w !</i> i was lucky during this time, most of these games were actually on autumn sale. portal 1 and 2 were in a bundle for <b><i>$1.70</i></b> man! A DOLLAR AND SEVENTY CENTS! THAT'S A <big>STEAL</big> of a <big><big>DEAL!</big></big> <small>(also i figured out that i can stack big and small tags to change the size of text even more, which is pretty cool.)</small> <small><small>(look see im incredibly small! wah!)</small></small> alright, that's enough fooling around with the small and big tags. next time it's just gonna be some cars racing around with the marquee tag.</p>
        <marquee behavior="alternate"; scrollamount="15">i mean, who could pass up the usage of this tag? this is just fun man lol</marquee>
        <br>
        <p>that aside again, if i were at home right now at not at school, i would've taken the time to give each game it's own review, but i'm currently in the <code>rather comedic school building</code> and the only cdli class i have during the afternoon is science, which is just right now a confusing pile of everything. compounds, assignments, portfolio(??????????), it's just incredibly hard for me to deal with. before that, i got english in which i continue working on the custom cover for my book, which is our final assignment for the book out of a few other choices. <i>one of them</i> was that you had to compose a song dedicated to the book. hell, im pretty sure the book in question, <b>lord of the flies</b>, was also mentioned by cgp grey at one time, the guy who drove across the loneliest road in america with a <b>tesla</b> of all things. the guy's pretty talented in both that <i>and</i> talking about some forms of history. i'd say something additional but i forgot what i was going to say originally.</p>
        <h2>12:01 pm</h2>
        <p>oh, the time's faster than me it seems. looks like i'll have to delay posting yet again and then start the several game review with i can. in regards to objectbloxia additionally, there's still the extra characters i need to go over ugh! might have to delay it until 3 pm or if i somehow have any additional time during 2 pm. off i go again! <i>ok bye!</i></p>
        <h1>5th</h1>
        <h2>11:35 am</h2>
        <p>ugh yeah this happens. i'm still at school so i won't be able to have any in-depth game reviews yet, only when i get back home. however, i will say that it'll start with the simple games and we'll increasingly get into the other stuff. just call this the review spectacular! reviewtactular. um. yeah, that'll probably be a good reason for me to change the title from <i>"power of the rather comedic visa gift card"</i> to something new that includes all of the topics, like i used to name stuff far earlier. how about <i>"ballistic baba marble bejeweled it up is you 3ng++ reviewtactular not sponsored by visa"</i>? ooh, that's a good one. i'll try that. note that the games will most certainly not be in order from the title itself, but rather on how long i may suspect the review itself is going to be. i think my last review was on the khonjin house movie or something from long ago. <a href="../../2018/09/18-9-9.html">oh yeah this post!</a> it was movie review 001. best i rename that now to just thingy review-y 002. that'd be cool. least i'll make use of it again after over a year! man i bet like at least one of you peoples are excited for these <b>Relevating Relevations</b>! aAha. ha. i got some time, not sure what i should do before i close off the post for another some period of time. um.

        <p>hey happy friday! per usual, i'm incredibly late and i'm at school again while i'm typing this, meaning i can't review the games. oh no i'm not at my own pc i can't play vibeo grames!!! this is actually kinda sad my friends <b>what will we <big>DO???????</big></b> because i have no idea. the only other thing i could really talk about is pretty off topic with the whole <i>game reviewing thing</i>. like what, do you want be to review solitaire, because bloody hell if that's what i gotta do, that's what i gotta do...the internet's down anyways so even <i>if</i> i wanted to review something like the original version of n++... i really <i>can't</i>. oh well! i guess now it's time for me to review solitaire while listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/eJeeAoKkcC0">this bloody good tune</a>. i believe i heard it on that united kingdom sight reading tournament. maybe one of those, <i>wario-ware type maps</i> that i see a lot.

                    <big>[002] - [microsoft solitaire collection]</big></p>
                    <p>microsoft solitaire collection is a game made by, well, microsoft. you know, those guys! they made all your favorite classics such as minesweeper and jigsaw back during the windows xp days. well, actually, they didn't make the <i>jigsaw</i> version, they only made that when they were able to do it during windows 10, which was <i>VERY</i> late if i had to be honest. imagine if someone had to wait this long in order to actually fucking play jigsaw. even <i>tabletop simulator</i> was able to do that a few years ago when it was first still in beta on kickstarter. like come on man at least have some decency.</p>
                    <p>most obviously, the important part of solitaire is none other than klondike, which was back then, the only game of cards besides hearts (i think as of windows 7? there's also spider solitaire and all that which we'll get into later). klondike is the name for the regular solitaire. rows of cards, put em in the stock pile. i remember when the school computers all used to run <i>windows xp</i> still, but now they're all windows 10, with a few being spared to windows 7 while only one computer in the barely used science lab still runs windows xp.</p>

        <p>all we need to do now is just start off with the simplest game here that isn't microsoft solitaire. i'm thinking bejeweled 3. however, time's running short again because i was too busy screwing around with html tags and seeing if i could actually get a better header/footer going, but it seems that isn't the case. that's just great, now is it. plus, well, the only other cdli class i have after this is just science, but i swear the moment i get back i'll hopefully be able to do some good ol' fashioned game reviewing? maybe?? <b>look man this blog post needs to end eventually, if this takes up all month i don't know what i'll do</b>. just, enjoy what's there for now.</p>

                    <big>[003] - [bejeweled 3]</big></p>
                    <!--review goes here-->
                    <p>bejeweled 3 is the game that candy crush wanted to be, but failed too hard by begging people to beg their friends on facebook for more levels. they have their similarities though. they're a match 3 game with special items being created from matching more than three in a move. unlike candy crush, bejeweled 3 is actually <i>fun</i>, and you don't have to suffer with the absolute <big>hellspawn</big> that is real time waiting for something arbitrary. a lot of games do this nowadays, i could go on for a <i>rather fair bit</i> on the topic of games that like to act like their scummy mobile game counterparts. voodoo being one of the biggest criminals when it comes to something like this. criminals of <i>stolen seconds of <big>TIME</big></i> that is! bejeweled 3 has it's 2 counterparts, bejeweled and bejeweled 2, but i have never played those before. i've only played bejeweled twist on my ds and most recently, bejeweled 3 on steam. i have <i>no</i> idea how it landed onto steam, so don't ask me how i was able to even grab it on steam anyways. the thing's like, a dollar. it's a steal. cheaper than portal 1 and 2 combined.</p>
                    <p>bejeweled 3 takes place in an unknown  world with rome like elements and you have an initial selection of four game modes. one being a trial in the mobile version of the game. why? mobile. don't underestimate the power of shitty business practices and mobile game developers.</p>
                    <center><img class="figure" src="/img/blog/2019/12/1749293957.jpg" width="75%"></center>
                    <p>when you initially start the game fresh, you get a selection of four modes with the other four being locked. you can unlock them by doing certain tasks in the main four modes, such as reaching a certain level in zen to unlock something. this is fine, however. these tasks are not absolutely impossible to achieve and they let you give the mode a shot!</p>
                    <h2>1:56 pm</h2>
                    well great, i have to go for the afternoon, i'll continue the review later.
                    <h2>8:27 pm</h2>
                    <p>welcome back to me reviewing bejeweled 3! we last left off on me being an actual fucking idiot and forgetting that i was writing stuff about this. back on track now, bejeweled doesn't really have a set story or anything unless you want to count the quest mode as something remotely related to lore. you can get the same amount of lore in candy crush in a <i>fortune cookie wrapper</i>. or maybe a candy wrapper. pretty sure one of them made spongebob cry at some point. not as in candy crush made him cry, rather the time patrick was reading the description of a candy wrapper. on relation of actual fuckin' game modes, you start off with classic, zen, lightning, and quest. classic is the regular match 3, keep matching until you're out of moves. zen doesn't have this and has oddly implemented zen features with ambience, lightning is zen but at a time limit and more powerups, and quest is the "story mode" of it all, containing a bunch of levels. i fucking hate poker iv. i hate it so much. oh my god.</p>
                    <h1>11th</h1>
                    <h2>1:04 pm</h2>
                    <p><small>(not gonna say anything. gonna move on with the review.)</small> let's try and get my opinions on all the modes, why don't we? let's begin with the main four, and then the side four.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            classic
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                                <p>the regular mode that some of us may or may not know and love. personally, i like the idea of this mode! rounds could technically last forever based on luck, but eventually, lady luck's going to get to you and you run out of moves. my way of trying to control this factor is to set up 5-gem specials called hypercubes which destroy all gems on the board that it swaps places with in classic match 3 fashion.</p>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            zen
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                                <p>zen is the same as classic mode, but instead of there being a chance to get no moves and losing the game <small>(meaning you aren't technically supposed to win bejeweled in classic mode)</small>, it generates gems to have something that indeed matches. and if all else fails, it just re-scrambles. the other thing about zen mode that's unique to itself are the ambience options you can put onto it. personally, zen mode is a very great addition to bejeweled, and takes all the stress out of it. great for relaxation!</p>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            lightning
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                                <p>if you loved having stress while doing match 3 constantly, this is for you! lightning is the same as zen mode as in you can never run out of moves, but this time, you're always running out of time to do your gem moves. you need to collect "time gems" to increase how much time you have and gain as many points as possible. you'll need a good memory and a well ironed out pair of eyeballs in order to do extraordinary in this mode.</p>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            quest
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                                <p>the main attraction of bejeweled 3, i think! this is where all the magic happens. the premise of quest mode is to complete enough challenges to rediscover the lost relics of bejeweled. i thought you had to do 4 out of the 8 you were given, but <i>nope!</i> it appears that you have to do ALL of them in order to fully bring back the lost relics. also, speaking of the challenges of the relics. whoever made poker iv, fuck you. just fuck you man. poker iv is amazingly random-number-generator-based torture. you'll get what i mean later down the line.</p>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            poker
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                                <p>this horrible son of a bitch is fucking the gods of randomness, and basically, you're fucking stupid. jokes aside now, poker is a horrendously luck-based mode. sure, classic mode is entirely dependant on your luck, but poker somehow makes it even worse. basically, you match gems in a way that make you create hands, and specific combinations get you credits. skulls appear and you need to make sure you don't score under the skull, or it becomes a 50/50 chance that you might lose. the quest version of this mode makes you have to score a specific amount of credits in a hand. in this case, you need to be so fucking lucky in order to do this mode any good. you're gonna need like several perfect matches to even get a <i>chance</i> at winning.</p>

                                <p>the second locked mode in the game (the first  being poker), diamond mine is where you use gems to burrow through the ground in order to collect treasure and descend further. if you complete a chunk of underground fast enough, you can accumulate time bonuses to advance further in the game. this could also mean it would technically last forever if you like to be insanely fast and effective during match 3 games. i haven't played this one much, but it looks fun.</p>

                            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                                <p>a more tactic-based mode where you have to match butterflies that appear from the bottom of the board and go up a gem every move you make. the premise is to match a butterfly with their matching gem to rescue them from the spider on the top of the board. if even one of the butterflies hit the spider at the top of the board, it's game over. this mode is great for people who take the extra time to think, as it allows for them to make more tactical moves to rescue as many butterflies as they can.</p>

                                <p>this is just an even more stressful version of zen, with constantly rising ice towers that climb up the board. you have to match gems to get rid of the ice before it fully freezes the board. personally, this is just way too stressful for me. i'm not sure if it's how the graphics are handled or the narrator's intimidating voice, but i'm just gonna assume it's both and tell you that it's not for the faint of heart. at all, really. stress is a fuck, man.</p>

                    <p>this actually covers all of the content for bejeweled 3 besides all the specific requirements for the quests in quest mode. besides that, bejeweled 3 is probably one of the best match 3 games you'll experience. no life meter waiting facebook god forsaken <big>bullshit</big>, it's just a regular match 3, with game modes and a zen mode so the game can also be used to do stuff such as managing stress. a good mixture of fun, stress, and relaxation. will lady luck be positive towards you today? only one way to really find out, that is.</p>

        <p>wew, that was a lot of information for one review alone! i'm glad i went a made a template for stuff like this, that stuff's gonna be something on it's own due to how much impact it has. this post has also eaten up an entire week alone now! it's the 11th by the time i was typing this and we started on the 7th! i'd say to split this into several parts, but the entire premise of this post is to review all the steam games that i bought that one time. after the reviews are done, i'll stop with this post for once. let me be real here, this has got to be one of the longest and biggest posts on this blog by far, and we haven't even used a video embed yet! maybe i'll showcase game music or gameplay itself during the next few reviews. i'd include some for bejeweled 3, but at this rate i think you'd get how everything would go anyways. i'll admit it now though, the soundtrack's pretty relaxing, despite not being my preferred type of music. you'll get to know that later in <b>ballisticng</b> later. actually, this gives me another thought. what if this post alone eats up the entire month of december? i fear that's slowly becoming something that might actually happen. is this the movie adaptation of rustmotherboard.github.io that we've all been waiting for? is this the transcript? am i actually sonic the hedgehog official? well, if you've ever had those rumors, i'm pretty much putting them all to rest and deconfirming all of that. sorry theorists that don't exist. i am incredibly lonely sometimes.</p>

                <big>[004] - [marble it up!]</big></p>
                <!--review goes here-->
                <p>marble it up! is a game created by i have no idea who, but hey it's the modern version of marble blast ultra. let me give you one of those <i>epic history lessons</i> on marble it up. the first variation of this game was a series of games called thr marble blast series. this series has the exact same premise of being a marble and travelling through obstacles while sometimes collecting gems. the first game originally released on pc, and had this weird cartoony style to it. the physics are something we'll get into later.</p>
                <img class="figure" src="/img/blog/2019/12/marble-blast-gold-5246.jpg">
                <h2>8:14 pm</h2>
                <p>this image here is a screenshot from the original marble blast gold, which is available to get <a href="https://marbleblast.com/index.php/downloads/mbg">here</a>, free of charge. this explanation from the same site, <b>marbleblast.com</b>, gives a detailed description on the game more than i do.</p>
                <p class="boxed"><i>"Marble Blast Gold revolves around controlling a colourful marble around different stages, with the goal getting to the end pad while avoiding falling off the level (Out of Bounds). Some levels even contain hazards to hinder the player’s progress and powerups to help him pass various challenges. Collecting gems is a requirement in some levels before players can complete the level. Some levels feature a Qualify Time in order to increase difficulty, and all levels feature a Gold Time, where players must finish the level below a specific time-frame. Beating Gold Times is not a requirement for progression in the game. Marble Blast Gold supports user created custom levels, which can be shared."<br><b>-marbleblast.com</b></i></p>
                <p>that out of the way, marble it up is made by a lot of the people who worked on the last marble blast sequel, marble blast ultra, as a new modern game with a new title and similar premise. this is where the game marble it up currently stands it up! i actually gave the modified version of marble blast gold a fair shot, and while the physics are indeed good, i would even say that the physics are actually better in that, then in marble it up! marble blast's physics seem much looser and make you jump higher, for more amplified levels. marble it up has a heavier marble and it doesn't bounce as much, leading to worse mid-air steering and such, making some levels an actual nightmare to deal with sometimes if you're cranking for a good rank in a level, which is based on time. some levels are open with the gem requirement, leading some players to be confused on what they're actually supposed to do in order to get the most optimal route.</p>
                <p>the physics for a physics based game is pretty fucking important if i had to be honest. without it, the game's a bunch of nothing. this makes marble it up a pretty meh game. i haven't tried the workshop levels yet though, so we'll wait on me playing workshop levels before i can give the game a new rating.</p>

                <p>baba is you about the game where the main point of the game is to <b>break the rules</b>, and by breaking, i mean absolutely demolishing the rules until it somehow begs for mercy. you are baba, the combination of everything pure in the world and a bunny. you like winning, but the rules put in place of you <i>do <b>not</b> want you to win</i>. this makes you very <big>NOT HAPPY >:(</big> until you push one of the rule blocks, causing the game to change. that's the game, changing the rules!</p>
                <center><img class="figure" src="/img/blog/2019/12/D1fUBtJUkAAQZEB.jpg" width="75%"></center>
                <p>levels that might seem impossible can be much of the opposite after changing a few rules. however, this can sometimes get highly complicated. this allows for more complex levels and sequences, allowing levels to vary wildly in difficulty. however, i don't really have a right to say anything about the game from that point onwards as i haven't actually <i>beat</i> the game. additionally, it would take a while for me to even finish the game to begin with considering how many levels there are. but, from what i've seen, the game's very fun yet confusing! i'm pretty sure the game's even turing complete, so it can technically play conway's game of life! check it out!!</p>

                <p>this comes to show how advanced a simple game can really get! plus, i hear a <i>level editors</i> coming out soon. that's going to allow for some SERIOUS COOL STUFF! maybe we'll get an entire rough clone of the legend the zelda if even POSSIBLE. there's probably going to be an obvious limit on how big the level can be, though.</p>

                <p>alright, imagine <b>mario kart</b>, the racing game with powerups, right? great. now imagine you're going at BREAKNECK SPEEDS with MUCH COOLER WEAPONS, and it's <big>NO BULLSHIT</big> either, with BUILT-IN WORKSHOP SUPPORT FOR CUSTOM SHIPS AND TRACKS. welcome to the world of <b>ballisticng</b>. if i had to be honest, this is one of the best racing games i've played in years. far too long have i been suffering with the slow cartoony game that is <i>mario kart</i>. too long has the dlc crippled my experience, and online being a pain in the ass <small>(SWITCH ONLINE)</small>. now with ballsiticng, all these worries and more have faded away! now we get to race with guns in a much more appealing and less copyrighted fashion! have i also ever told you how good the soundtrack is? it fits one of my favorite genres of music! fast electronic percussion!</p>
                <h2>9:46 am</h2>
                <p>whoops, time's cutting short again. i'll see you guys after the one subject and recess break. although, since it's science as the next cdli class, i have doubts i'll even get a breathing moment to actually <i>type</i> anything. alright bye!</p>
                <h1>13th</h1>
                <h2>9:16 am</h2>
                <p>alright i'm back, on with more talking about stuff. ballisticng is fast(er) mario kart with guns. however, this game isn't something entirely new! it's <i>actually</i> based off of a pre-existing game that was made alongside the playstation and became a staple ever since. let me introduce you to <b>wipeout</b>, the racing game and not the game show about not falling into the ocean as best as you can from a bunch of stuff hitting your face. the playstation was a console that told you, "hey, i'm not some <i>kids toy</i>, you nintendo worshipping dog pile of CAT SHIT. i'm an ADULT CONSOLE, not a BABY CONSOLE". what i mean by this is that the games on the playstation usually don't have the ESRB's E rating, usually T to M. there's not really any in the A18 section because why would anyone do that besides some lonely fuck? anyways, the premise of <i>video game wipeout on the playstation</i> is that you're set in the future, sometimes around 2180, and well <i>you</i> don't really matter because <big>who the FUCK ordered <b>lore</b> in <b>MY</b> racing game???</big> wipeout just sends you straight into the game like n++ and you're free to choose from a gradual campaign mode or maybe one of those custom race modes. not sure if they actually have it, but ballisticng sure does. wipeout first had <i>some</i> form of lore into it with actual DRIVER NAMES for ships instead of being called liveries. that bothers me because i just wanna see a racing game, not people. like holy FUCK that was the entire point of <b>PGR4</b> aka project gotham racing 4 <small>(ALSO WHERE THE FUCK IS THE FIFTH INSTALLMENT MAN C'MON!!!!)</small>. over the course of 12 years, wipeout got new installments usually when a new console rolled around from sony. sometimes they released more than one per console, which is pretty good. the latest game in the franchise appears to be <b>wipeout omega collection</b> on the ps4 as of right now. the wipeout omega collection is the combination and recreation and remastering of three different wipeout games. the physics probably got changed though. there's several methods to how to move your ship around in games like these that it becomes needlessly complicated over time.</p>
                <p>alright, here's ballisticng in proper show and less tell. (images taken from the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/473770/BallisticNG/">steam page</a>)</p>
                <img class="figure" src="/img/blog/2019/12/bng1.jpg" width=100%>
                <img class="figure" src="/img/blog/2019/12/bng2.jpg" width=100%>
                <p>like, i'll be honest. this game just fits my tastes in both art and gaming. a perfect mixture of fast paced action, fighting, custom content, and interesting and detailed environments. it reminds me of my own project named <a href="../../../projects/klaust_.html">klaust_</a> in the art style and lore, mainly the future related stuff. i wonder if vonsnake will ever make a cyberpunk dlc. that'd be great! anyways, i'm sure the images show the main concept here. you drive around in a futuristic flying ship and have to get first place. although other modes might not be this way (more on this in a second!). question is, how fast can we get? well, why <b>describe it</b> when i could <b>directly show you</b> instead??</p>

                <p>yeah like <b>holy FUCKING SHIT THAT'S FAST?</b> i would barely be able to do anything at that type of speed! also, note that this was uploaded during when ballisticng was still in it's early access phase. i'm pretty sure the game used to be free during this time, but now it's just an incredibly good deal at $8, and $15 if you wanna throw in the soundtrack too. buy the soundtrack. by the way, if you actually watched the video, you might have seen the guy playing the game do some SICK CARTWHEELS. i'm not sure if that's still in the latest version of this game! might be on a different physics engine now, the default one's 2180.</p>
                <p>alright, i've glossed over all these really cool and good details, it's time to explain the modes that i actually know about! bejeweled 3 review style!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        race

                            <p>self explanatory. be the first to win! default options allow you to use weaponry in order to eliminate your opponents, whether it's shooting them with guns or something of the usual.</p>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                            <p>the same as race, but it's the last one standing who wins, not the one who's in first place after a step number of laps.</p>

                            <p>again the same as race but the racer in last place gets eliminated at the end of each lap. last one standing wins!</p>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>so yeah, i'll see you guys when the next cdli class happens or when i get home. alright see you bye and then i'll continue on the other ballisticng modes.</p>
                <h2>11:06 am</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        time trial
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                            <p>it's most certainly what you think it is! time trials is where you do a regular no-weapon race in order to get the best times. for some reason, saving times only works with the default ships and not any of the custom ones you may get from the workshop or discord server for the game.</p>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        speed lap
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                            <p>arguably, this is the game's <i>"practice mode"</i> as it allows you to race endlessly in a track without weapons (besides a boost every time you do a lap) and infinite hp. this allows you to get used to certain tracks on any ship at any speed class. personally, this could also be the game's zen mode, maybe. either that or you can watch the idle screen when you're in the game's main menu, as it shows a race for you to watch. cool, huh?</p>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        survival
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                            <p>one of the modes from the wipeout series imported into ballisticng. your ship is ALWAYS constantly going faster, and you have to survive for as long as possible. i hope you like going amazingly fast in <b>H Y P E R  Z E N</b>

                <p>and that's what most of the modes are! this might be all of them but either way that's the modes. it's time for the conclusion!</p>
                <p>in conclusion, ballisticng is the representation of racing games, despite being one of the more niche games that i know. but, if i know anything about wipeout (that being not much at all), this might as well be the next fucking game in the franchise, because it's bloody great. probably even better than the original wipeout itself due to the custom content. <small>(I HAVE 500+ CUSTOM TRACKS)</small> ballisticng is the definition of anti-gravity racing at high speeds. with guns. buy the game <b>AND</b> soundtrack.</p>

        <p>we went through an entire HEADER during this time, holy fuck! i really gotta try and not put so much into one singular post so much. this post alone took up an entire week's worth of my time. like, look how long this has been! this is the <b>TRUE</b> longest post on this entire god forsaken website. is this the peak? do we go father from here? the only thing we can do now is wait until the next post. next time on rust_, i have absolutely no fucking clue. something about minecraft maybe? possibly more finobe, that game's sorta on something else right now. i wonder if anyone's sent me email. you know, i don't think i've even revealed my email address yet for mail. well, now introducing <b>rustmotherboard@outlook.com</b>! now you can commit strong bad email and send me an email! the good ones (or the only ones) will be answered in it's own post! imagine that! imagine all the spam mail! imagine how much my spam filter is gonna have to sit through! LITERALLY NOTHING, ISN'T THAT AMAZING!</p>
