    hi it's me rust and im totally not trying to act like scott the woz with my intro .  no one has actually <i>told</i> me that but i just suspect SOMEONE's gonna do that RATHER COMEDIC THING and call me OuT oN iT and then i get <b>cancelled</b> on Twitter and then my Windows gets in d a n g e r e    which is NOT VERY GOOD. anyways yeah im currently in career class and one of my friends is trying to make another "weird story" for the 40324823rd time, with the only difference making it interesting is that some other person from the class is using the voice chat to sound russian and actually READ THE STORY........ yeah imagine havin like a <b>really COOL russian accent</b> and using it to say the weirdest fuckin stories in the history of MANKIND.
    <p class="boxed"><b>
        one time, there was an extremely saturated cheerio [running] down the rain gutter when the loch ness monster ate it and crunched his earlobes but as it turns out, it [wasn't] the loch ness monster... it was the garbage man named d'sarwinny</b>
        <br>
        - the guy who makes these weird ass stories that someone with a russian voice can read
    </p>
    yeah stuff like this is crazy. our teacher actually have to give him a new sort of "weird story quota" because it escalated to the point where it just distracts the <i>entire damn class</i>. it was worth it thought.no we get to hear them in russian if it wasn't out of this world enough!!! anyways yeah, i can never keep a promise on blog posts can i...... least i've been able to push them out daily for a good bit, can't wait to JINX THAT!!!. anyways today we're gonna continue off and start talking about the roleplay that i was going to mention from <a href="19-11-14.html">part 2</a> so check that out if you haven't already. alright, let's get down to business with that.
    <br>
    <br>
    the roleplay begins with me getting the morph for square style nitori, which if you don't remember, is the character from touhou that likes cucumbers and builds epic machines. was probably the girl that invented the double decker toaster .  <b>very Smart move!</b> i don't have many screenshots but for the one that i do have i'l save for when we get to it. anyways! we begin with nitori actually going to the objectbloxia mainland and going <i>"well B L I M E y   look at This!!!!!!!! it's STUFF!"</i> and proceeds to check out pretty much everything. we got the metal box, giant oven, hand powered recovery center, y'know, because i'm pretty sure everyone's fine with a <b>big ass oven</b> just casually hanging about the place. anyways, nitori did not give a FUCK about any of that because she found what she used as a base to make her next flying machine of really coolness.
    <br>
    <br>
    y'know, a flying tree. the usual thing. somewhat uncommon type of tree in objectbloxia but it does the job for.. being a tree, i guess. a half job, since half of it doesn't even exist.
    <br>
    <br>
    nitori took the tree and decided to make a rather interesting flying machine with it after saying "well blimey if it isn't a FLYING TREE!! what a nice scientific revolution, i could MAKE SOMETHING WITH THIS.......". so she made the funny and had some trouble to get it flying. in the end it all worked out. ladies and <b>F R I C K S</b>... may i introduce you to the NITORI MOBILE!!!!!!!!!

    a true wonderful invention if i had to be honest, one of the best! forget everything else <b>including</b> club ice and club rust, get ready for the NITORI MOBILE, work at it's fucking FINEST. the rest of the roleplay was just me flying around in the mobile till i got bored and got off of it. ...<b>BUT IM Not done yET!!!</b>. THAT'S right you thought it was OVER?? not yET!!! because this is where it gets interesting. master decides to join in midway while im doing the funny airplane thing so i LAMP him with <code>:light</code> and <code>:jail</code> and he then becomes the lamp. master was always the person that i just fucking downright <b>HATED</b> due to the stuff that he says towards others and how he wants to kill the entire furry population like that's NORMAL by any means. let me just tell you now that it is NOT NORMAL at all to try and do such thing. you're already dealing with a large enough crowd of people and you want to commit GENOCIDE on them. like this isn't <i>madness combat</i> my dude it ain't entertaining unlike MADNESS COMBAT like HOO BOY. anyways yeah, when master is put in lamp jail, he's... somewhat more tolerable unless he says a bad. happens fucking <b>constantly</b> and i hate it.
    <br>
    <br>
    i actually had fun with the whole lamp thing and tried to integrate it into the roleplay a little bit. there was a bit of area made with f3x over near the 10,000 steps challenge from BF{B}DI[DFB](A) (the new hip acronym for mentioning BFDI in any of it's four seasons) so i teleported master there and lamped him. as nitori this would be a RATHER INTERESTING TYPE OF <b>LAMP</b> if i had to be honest on that. she mentioned "like WOW it's one of those WEIRD LAMPS. i've never sene a lamp like this, is it suppose to be one of those national monuments or something Hah Hah". i'm probably not very good at roleplaying as nitori just yet but i'm Learning so at least give me some time. i mean, we all had to start somewhere, didn't we? <i>didn't we?</i> anyways yeah that was one of the sideplots, but the main thing that kept the nitori train going was the NEW PLOT !!!  so on the server there were some trusted users and moderators who were part of the furry community (which we all know that <code>master</code> just DESPISES), and one of the characters was a short white fluffy one that i forgot the name of, and they told me (nitori) that snowi had died. now, snowi was one of wolfgirl's (the changed (something that i don't want to explain (please don't ask me what it is (it's horrible (ah))))) characters with orange blood. for the sake of storytelling i'll just call the short white one jerry or something i have no fucking clue lol.
    <br>
    <br>
    anyways jerry and nitori went over to near the forest's campfire and snowi was found dead in MIAMI......... yikes my dude i can't believe snowi bleeds orange juice. that joke was from nitori said. "bro i never knew those type of creatures bleed orange juice". this upset jerry beyond comprehension. after this sad revelation of eventful turns, pementa (roleplaying as <b>colossal (which i think is supposed to be the object version of a tv logo or something (could be wrong))</b>) joins in and offers to check snowi's pulse to make sure she's not just unconscious or she's hanging onto life by a mere fucking THREAD. after some intense checking of the pulse by standing next to snowi, colossal states that she is indeed, <b>dead</b> in miami. this upset everyone besides nitori, since she was just dragged into the situation with little to no context on what the fuck's even going on to begin with. the first thing that came to her mind when it came to a dead body was to dump it into the ocean (or to bury it), which everyone literally tried to stop nitori from doing, but she already had the body picked up and put on her head (i mean she's a square how else are we gonna portray her carrying something without putting it on top of her), making her somewhat slower but she got a bit close to the ocean before someone had the idea of using the hand powered recovery center in the main part of the mainland so she could be recovered. needless to say, that actually worked. problem solved! nitori then talked about cucumbers and stood still for 20 minutes before <i>i</i> got bored and left the server, ending the roleplay for myself.
    <h2>12:03 pm</h2>
    i'd love to continue from here but this actually ends this blog post about nitori and i wanted to shift to a different topic since this is a 3 parter. in this case, that ends today's blog post and i'll be going to the next post when i come back during the afternoon when i have social studies last subject today. it's friday, what else am i supposed to say>
    <br>
    <br>
    anyways bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?
