    <h1>day before the long weekend something something</h1>
    <h2>9:59 pm</h2>
    hello once again! i'm rust while in school, and today's none other than a pretty good day, if i do say so my do say so myself (iidssmdssm). you wanna know <i>why</i> im feeling this rather positive on a mere THURSDAY???? (wait it's not FRIDAY what????????? IMPOSSIBLE) well, today's none other than the day before the long weekend. in memory of remembrance day, newfoundland schools (including mine <i>and</i> cdli courses) will be closing on friday and monday, which is always pretty cool and good! you know, times like these always remind me of the fact that <b>2019 is almost over</b>! can you BELIEVE it?? it's already been 11 months and we've seen so much new, <code>horrifying</code> stuff for the year. i've had a lot of experiences during the time of 2019, and i've come to appreciate everything that i've been through.
    <br>
    <br>
    enough beating around the bush for now, what i'm here to discuss today is what remembrance day is and whats going on, and then it's free sailing from here. <b>remembrance day</b> is a national yearly holiday on the 11th of november dedicated to all of the soldiers who bloody <i>died</i> during the amazingly gruesome event that we call world war 2.
    <p class="footnote">footnote: one day, we'll have a world war 3 that'll be entirely on twitter. i hate to be the BOOMER saying that but hey i'd be down for an online world war if we ever decide to get one of those someday.</p>
    world war 2 being.. not really good, to the point where even the board game monopoly had to get itself it's own world war 2 version. families were horrified and upset, and people born after world war 2 probably wouldn't even understand a single thing about it. y'know, until the school makes them learn about it during history or social studies, <i>but my point still stands on the matter</i>.
    <h2>10:17 am</h2>
    so the current assignment im working on as of right now before i have to go for recess (and then <b>french</b>, ugh) and then social studies and <b>ENGLISH</b> (ugh i hate that too man no wonder the evil dude in homestuck is named "english" they're both annoying DOUCHEBAGS!!!!!), but after <i>all</i> of that, i'll be free for FOUR DAYS!! which is KINDA COOL!! here's the questions that i'll be dealing with, feel free to answer them yourself and put it in the comment section if you want to bother with social questions from a career class.

    we're back for more! turns out i have career today. fun fact, despite the fact that we have a 14 day schedule, the subjects on it actually repeat itself, meaning there's actually a fewer amount of <b>unique</b> days, meaning days when we have different subjects. about our cdli career class, sometimes there's a post on the announcement thread stating today's historic fact. i thought it'd be rather Cool and Good if i shared it with you all today, so here's your <b>Today in History Time</b> that i'll probably only do once or twice.

    <br>
    (i also just learnt how to have different box styles and image borders, <i>sweet!</i>) anyways, so today whiled i listen to stuff about the 95 theses again, i wanted to discuss about something else this time around so it doesn't feel like you're reading some overly quirky history lesson about how someone invented the printing press and then we're told that <i>"it'll be important later on"</i>. for the hour i wanted to actually discuss on my gripes with something none other than rhythm games. yeah, you ever heard of.. <i>notITG</i>? stepmania? that one madagascar flash game that is <b>obviously the more superior game of the three</b>? no, seriously. that was a thing. im pretty sure it was a thing. does no one else remember that one flash game where you had to dance ton very slowly moving arrows shaped like alex's paws? im not sure why still remember that, but it's a funny thing to note when including rhythm games.
    <br>
    <br>
    so stepmania is sorta this thing where you have a dance pad with the arrows <b>up</b>, <b></b>, <b></b>, and <b></b>. y'gotta press them as they appear on the indicators in which are timed to some of yur favorite music that's sometimes just anime openings that no one knows about besides  the people who are immersed in the show or just regular fans of said anime. rhythm games are notorious for having a lot of, y'know, <i>anime openings</i>for some reason, but this is totally fine. i see no issue with it. <code>*in burning house holding a good ol cup of pineapple soda*</code> yeah see this is totally fine not like im going to explode or anything hahahahahah. if you want to know what a stepmania actually looks like, um............ here eat this.

    yeah, the video on the right is <i>ENTIRELY</i> made with an open source fork of a fork of stepmania called in the groove called notITG (not in the groove). i wanna say props to taro (the guy who uploaded the video) for showing us some of the best nITG/stepmania files that the world has ever seen. such creativity into just one rhythm game engine. you can only do so much with it until you know the code inside and out, left and right.
    <br>
    <br>
    now what does all of <b>THAT</b> have to do with my gripes on rhythm games? well, besides the introduction, i wanted to first point out that information because i want to say that <code>(n)ITG/SM IS NOT BAD</code>. it's great, even! i just wanted to talk about some experiences that i've had with my time with games like these as a whole. let's first talk about one of the more obvious details if you watched the mawaru video that i embedded (not linked, EMBEDDED), that being distractions in modern simfiles (the name for stepmania/nITG files). this is more of my personal issues since i suck at reading with distractions, but i still wanted to talk about it, even if it <i>is</i> just me being ashamed that i can't read 4 arrow patterns well at all with a keyboard.
    <h2>2:00 pm</h2>
    now i'd talk about it some more but i got life skills so I HAVE TO POSTPONE AGAIN OK BYE <code>*explodes*</code>
