        <p>well, it was a painful process just trying to find what jekyll themes will work. turns out, none of them did! i guess it's just so <em>broken</em> and whatnot it just <strong>won't</strong> work with what i got.</p>

        <p>for now, if any of you guys want a dark theme, use a browser extension or whatever. that should do the job.</p>
