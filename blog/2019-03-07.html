        </p>

        <p>Ah yes, the school I attend. With a dazzling 25 or so students, small faculty, and (very) low quality standards, you'd think the building would've been phased out for a primarily online service by now. Well, you're wrong. That place is still going. For more than... some period of time. In regards to it's small students and faculty, the school used to be filled with students, somewhere in the 50s, like a regular school that should have those amount of students constantly. The thing is, when you’re in a place where barely any new people show up, you’re going to pretty much expect the amount of students in the building to decline from “wow, that’s a lot”, to “wow, that’s pretty much no one at all”, over the course of a decade. The small amount of students is also what also caused the small amount of faculty, although it’s been roughly the same amount for them for a good few years now, far as I know.</p>

        <p>Our school likes to have this annual tradition, where for a full week (besides weekends, obviously), the faculty and/or student council (a group in which students help out deciding activities and special events for the school that the students can participate in) prepare events that take up either half or the full day of the schedule. These events can range from an outdoors scavenger hunt, to a so-called “magic carpet ride” where everyone just scoots on their butt on a towel across the gym floor to one side and the other. That’s more or less, like, real footage of the new live action Aladdin movie that probably won’t get very good ratings at all. You’ve seen the other ones, they didn’t last well either.</p>

        <p>Anyhow, the main point of well, this post in it’s entirety. Education week! The annual holiday in which the school attempts to do something fun with it’s students and host activities and events. It’s been going strong for more than 80 years, which is definitely a long time by all means. I mean, what if a certain local event also lasted as long as that? Long traditions thrive strong, I tell you. Now, personally, my thoughts on Education Week are kind of mixed, honestly. Some years, they’re actually pretty fun with a lot of time spent into them. The gym on some occasions is completely prepared with stations littered everywhere, just for an afternoon of a school recreation of a rather unpopular game show called Minute to Win it, where contestants had to do certain things in a minute or less in order to win cash prizes. The difference in our version is that it’s in a gym, there’s no prizes, and it actually lasts 2 minutes per challenge instead of one, because god forbid we’re actually fast enough to do any of this in the first place.</p>

        <p>However, even if some education weeks were good, there’s also the fair share of bad ones as well. I can’t stress how some education weeks in my honest/personal opinion can be classified as a total wreck of improper scheduling and little effort put into the ideas, alongside recycled ideas. I’ll tell you this now, a lot of the events from education week are just copies. This includes Minute to Win it, keeping a balloon in the air for as long as possible (which goes against the title of the event in the first place, since that definitely lasts longer than a minute of all timeframes), and the majority favourite, outside scavenger hunts. Sort of reminds me of another event that’s not as exciting, but it’s called the Terry Fox Walk, where our school walks around the hometown, raising awareness, donating money, all of that. However, for a few years now, the weather has always been really crappy, which meant our school had to go indoors in order to actually do the whole “walking” thing. It’s more or less just bad luck on our end, and not some higher being making all of this shit happen. If so… well… yeah, we’re getting out of this place.</p>

        <p>Alright, enough talking about what education week as an event is, now’s the time to discuss how this week’s education week has been! Now, you may think it’d be more or less, really fun. For some people, yeah, it would. However, if you were to ask me on how the whole thing went, I’ll tell you only 2 words to sum up a weeks worth of whatever the hell was going on.</p>

        <p>Pure. Shit.</p>

        <p>Yeah, so this education week in my personal opinion is one of the worst ones I’ve seen in a good while. Sure, some of them had their issues, but this one just takes the cake out of all of them. The amount of issues, planning failures, and horrid experiences all lead to one big steamy pile of Newfoundland-brand “what the fuck is this shit” soup, with it’s own Fortnite brand big orange spoon to put all of that soup in your gross mouth. Not like it’d taste any good in the first place.</p>

        <p>Because of how overly long this blog post is going to be compared to most others, I’ll be splitting this into several parts, so that you won’t be bored to death reading what’s pretty much the equivalent of a movie transcript, or at least, a transcript for a 20 minute episode of SpongeBob. The first part will cover the first day or so, and then the next part(s) will cover the rest of the few days, ending with a conclusion. Anyways, best we get this introduction over with, as it’s roughly around 1,000 words purely on it’s own, which is actually pretty ridiculous, and more or less a bad sign that there’s going to be a lot for me to complain about. Anyways, let’s begin with our fabled friend, Monday.</p>

        <p>Monday is where our events start to take shape. Although I don’t remember much from this, I can note about one very memorable thing that was going on during this time. For this one, the entire school (still 25 or so) was split into a few groups of 4, and we were all doing stations related to… anti-bullying. Yeah, kind of stupid, but hey, a lot of other schools do this, so we can’t really blame them for this sort of thing, but the quality was still poor nonetheless. I wasn’t interested for the most part of it. However, what takes the cake for Monday which made the experience a living hell was one of my group members, which I’ll cover about right now.</p>

        <p>Alright, so, there’s this one kid in the younger grades that we’ll name Jack, for lack of a better name as of the time of this post. Anyways, this guy is very annoying and sometimes entitled. He’s the guy who just so happened to also be in my group. I dreaded being around him, honestly. He’s pretty much a rendition of those kids you see being really “cringe-enduing” for lack of a better term, trying to be “cool and hip” and such. His definition of cool and hip is to do as many Fortnite emote dances as he possibly can while standing around. For some people, they can easily ignore this. Not me, though. I found this to be very annoying, and it pissed me off rather quickly. Now, I didn’t take extreme action thankfully, but it could’ve happened if another event made everything worse from there on out (which will happen in a few days from now, so we’ll get to that when we, well, get to it). Now, the action that I did was pretty reasonable. I politely asked him to stop doing those dances because they were getting annoying. You want to know what he replied with?</p>

        <p>“No.”</p>

        <p>The guy just flat out said no. Can you believe this 6th grader? I tried talking him out of the situation, saying the reasons as of why I want him to stop, the usual. He just kept on saying no and started walking away from me, in order to deliberately avoid me, while still doing the “L” dance in front of other people. I swear to goodness, the amount of times I asked him could get me enough to buy a Sodastream if each one was worth a dollar.</p>

        <p>Now, back on the topic of the whole anti-bullying matter, it worked kind of like how the Minute to Win it event used to work before it got changed, which will also be addressed at a later part. Now, there were several stations related to anti-bullying that each group had to do, per a few minutes before they had to switch. I won’t get into detail about each individual station, but I’ll say that my least favourite one was the one where we all had to wear silly outfits in a pink color scheme, and we all took group photos, which I hear the teachers will be sending over to Facebook, which I don’t want happening. However, I guess that’s too late now to prevent.</p>

        <p>Now, what makes this the least favourite for me (besides the fact that everyone looks ridiculous, more than how ridiculous it sounds when Luigi says “you look ridiculous” in Mario Gold) is me hoping by all means that Jack would stop doing Fortnite dances in front of me. However, when I tried telling him to stop at this point, he said something a little different.</p>

        <p>“Stop, bully.”</p>

        <p>The fact he called me a bully when trying to ask him to just politely stop actually kind of hurts. And on anti-bullying day of all days. The guy just decided to call me out for asking for someone to stop doing something that was annoying me. He was trying to annoy me. He was being annoying just cause he wanted to. He tried not to listen. How could someone like him just flat out do that, and how much more longer will I be asking such annoying ass questions? Most likely for a lot longer than all of you will ever want to experience.</p>

        <p>Now, I would like to continue on more on how the rest of the weekend went, but this post is already getting long enough, and I don’t want this to take up most of my front page on the blog while it remains on there, so I’ll leave it at that for now and leave the rest for parts 2 and onwards. By the way, sorry for not adding in images to this post. It’s pretty long, and it’s more or less talking about more bad experiences. I’ve also been using Word 365 to type all of this, since Blogger’s editor being in the web browser can make stuff just more or less more clunky. More or less, I’ll see you guys later, and see you in part 2, or whatever post comes up next.</p>
