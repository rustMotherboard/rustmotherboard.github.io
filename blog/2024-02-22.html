		<p>hey! i got the blog back up again, as i learnt that tumblr's full of shit now (and so is cohost, supposedly)</p>

		<p>more specifically this is kinda the only major thing from my website that i never brought back in the last four years. i took the time (so just all of today) refactoring all of the code on the old blog posts so they work on the current 2024 framework</p>

		<p>honestly i was considering not including the old blog posts, i personally don't like a single one of them anymore and i was a real annoying loser by the way i was typing things. especially with that whole 'education week' bit. like i was just the biggest asshole in the world that week and i only cemented it by <code>"Talking like a real serious college professor or some shit."</code></p>

		<p><span class="rainbow">fortunately i'm past that now!</span> due to me not really wanting to edit more of the posts i'll just say that anything prior to this post doesn't entail what i actually talk or present work like, and is, therefore, a product of its time</p>

		<p>i might consider making sequel posts to some posts for thoughts on things now about 4 to 6 years later from when i first started the blog. did i ever say in those past posts that a good chunk of them were written during school? ah, whatever i'll just say it now. i did!</p>

		<p>for what i'll post to the site's blog from here on out, it'll probably be long-winded stuff about projects i work on that i can publicly talk about, the processes of it, or maybe some old fun stories i wanna retell to the 3 people who read this site! <span class="rainbow">thank you</span> for reading by the way!</p>
		
		<p>^ woah, fast rainbow effect</p>

		<p>really the only other update i added was that <a href="/projects/cfan6.html">cfan6</a>'s comic pages are back to being hosted on this repository specifically rather than a seperate repository. this keeps it easier to manage personally</p>

		<p>one last thing since i'll probably forget to mention, but i've also silently updated the site to have a brand new mirror! i heard that github's also not exactly the best platform to host things (microsoft owned, anti-FOSS using the walled garden approach for developers), so i researched and found codeberg, which is essentially a more FOSS version of github running on a fork of gitea. it took some weird shit to get it up and running using tokens and many failed github actions (which i ended up taking out), but now you can access this same site under codeberg's domain! commits seem to work between github and codeberg now too which is nice.</p>

		<p>if you want my personal preference, try the codeberg version of the site out next time you're here, because i'm pretty sure it updates faster than github! probably because the actions sytem is different and it doesn't take a solid minute to boot up. not that i ever found that to be a problem honestly but hey codeberg's faster</p>

		<p>but yeah thanks for readin up on my website, if you wanna talk about posts in specific mention it on my userbox at the index (ifindex) page</p>
