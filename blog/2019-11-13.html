        <p>hi it's me rust i'm very stressed because i've been trying to get prepared for my science test but it's actually TODAY and the study notes are NOTHING BUT QUESTIONS without telling me what the actual information is i am very STRESSED about it. why do tests have to be like this? the study guides don't help out that much and all i have are my previous unit 1 notes that only cover ONE CHAPTER. the test is supposed to cover the entire unit and it's about weather. speaking of weather, it's also very foggy outside, yet it's bright enough that it's not too dark where i am. otherwise besides all of that i'm actually doing pretty fine for myself. i'm just tired is all.</p>

        <p>today im going to continue with some objectbloxia stuff that happened last night. if you remember from last post, master joined a server when i just finished working on the new club, and master just tried to be as uncomfortable as possible, so pem and i did our best to handle with the situation so the others could actually work on stuff. however, master persisted, and was just <b>determined</b> to piss us off some way or another. master even kept calling me a furry, which he hates if you remember that detail. if i had to be honest, the guy probably has nothing better to do than just spam his garbage on the game.</p>

        <p>some admin stuff later, i started to get tired of most of this. for one, master never joins object whatever if im correct, object whatever is say the other object roleplay game on roblox that im aware of. it actually has <i>more</i> popularity than objectbloxia with more daily players during prime time, and there's way more areas, improved scripts, and other features that are interesting. i currently have plans to join the <b>dev team</b> of that game after building an example model that cherry (the game's creator) is actually going to use, the model being for gelatin's steakhouse, more based off of the BFDIA counterpart rather than the BFB counterpart, where it's more wide and shorter. cherry actually really liked the model and said that i'd be able to join the dev team, which have their own custom morphs too.</p>

        <p>the one downside with object whatever might be it's "3rd party rule". the 3rd party rule is when you play as a character that isn't an object, and that's about it. something like "red plumber hat" to hint to mario would be the closest we can get to, however. luckily, i have made original characters in the past, so i can get my own decals included eventually in the super cool secret dev menu. i'd continue the discussion with this but y'know it's</p>

        <h2>9:49 am</h2>

        <p>so yeah. self explanatory. k see you bYE AGAIN</p>
