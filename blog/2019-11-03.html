        <h2>5:16 pm</h2>
        <p>oops it seems like i overslept while trying to explain something just as i was about to get to the good stuff. that's never a good thing. thankfully i have full idea on what i was trying to talk about earlier, so i'll continue from where we left of. to recap, i was going to talk about the time where i had to reinstall windows entirely because i was trying to install ubuntu with poke on a discord voice chat when i had the idea of changing the memory drive in the device manager in order to detect the c drive, which wasn't being detected.</p>

        <p>now that you've been recapped to where we last left off,we now go to the more interesting stuff and when things take a turn for the worst!</p>

        <p class="boxed">UH OH. YOU'VE ENTERED EPIC BOOT LOOP MODE. OH SNAP. OH GOD OH FU</p>

        <p>that's right! windows decided to go into a boot loop. in my opinion, that's probably not how laptops are supposed to work, but that shit's rocket science. my laptop won't boot! this obviously got me freaking out and i tried to tell poke that it didn't work and it also made the situation much worse than i wished it should've.</p>

        <h2>6:29 pm</h2>

        <p>so yeah my laptop wasn't feeling too good. a boot loop is when a device keeps repeating the state in which it attempts to turn itself on. because of this, i instantly went into very official rust_ panic mode, the one mode that can rise against gay feelings mode. now, this was in one of the two memory modes in bios. the other mode just straight up crashes the laptop until reboot, so i wasn't able to do anything with the current laptop.</p>

        <h2>7:07 pm</h2>

        <p>some more freaking out later, poke suggested to me that i have to reinstall windows! after failing to boot into the bios several times, i decided to agree with poke and think that it was the only option. now, here was the plan. i was going to get a windows 10 iso, put it into the usb drive that ubuntu's being run on, and then make it a flash drive. seems simple enough? not unless you have only a 2 GB USB and just your normal laptop. i actually thought all hope was lost lol. HOWEVER!!!! thankfully, due to the fact that i switch laptops every now and again, i am now in the possession of something called a spare laptop. what's one of <i>those?</i> well, it's pretty much a laptop that you don't use but still fully works. it's actually before the aspire es17! this was my old gateway laptop. it's somehow bigger than the nitro 5 (the laptop that i currently use) yet runs slower and probably can't even run minecraft. it's truly a real <b>SHAME</b> that it doesn't work. HAHA. HHAHAHAA. UKSRT REFERENCE HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHHAHAHHAHHAHA</p>

        <h2>8:11 pm</h2>

        <p>the problem with my house is that my family never even bothers to have more than 1 usb stick, let along one that can even hold an <code>.iso</code> file. now, you may be wondering besides if im even sane or not. what's a disc image file, and why can't it work with the usb? the problem with that is in relation to the file sizes and how big the USB can handle things. the <code>iso</code> for windows 10 according to microsoft is more than 2 GB, which my USB stick is unable to handle, which is too bad. because of this, i thought getting any of this working was eventually a lost cause that couldn't be fixed at all. however, poke, the legend, actually found a finnish iso of windows while i was watching jontron on the ubuntu version of firefox, trying to not bore myself to death just waiting for him to reply if he knows any way for me to plausibly fix this situation.</p>

        <p>let me try and explain how this works. the finnish version of windows is (for some reason) smaller than the original english version of windows 10's <code>.iso</code>. i don't know why it works like that, but that goodness that the finnish were able to figure out how to compress files to the point where they big for mercy. however, that could also either be just because of how the language works or how it didn't come with any of those SUPER SPECIAL OMEGA WOW WOW DRIVERS that are CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT in order to do such AMAZING ACTIONS as connecting to the <b>DAMN</b> internet. this here was the plan. i downloaded the iso from poke onto the old laptop, then i put it into the 2 gb usb when plugged in to the old laptop and turn the usb into a boot drive. plug the usb into the malfunctioning laptop and reboot into it by changing the order of which things boot in the bios.</p>

        <p>seems complicated enough? get this, even <i>with</i> all the precautions took, the fact that i changed the memory drive from the devices manager caused all my troubleshooting options from windows to stop working. hard resetting from windows fails to work, safe mode doesn't work, going back to windows takes you back into the boot loop of DOOM, and all system restore points get corrupted and don't work. they probably wouldn't have done anything anyways if i had to be honest. because of this, i had fucked windows to the point where reinstalling it entirely was the <i>only</i> option. i am <b>so</b> glad that i own that 4 tb usb drive where i keep all my important files and most of my programs. thank god for that. anywho, it's BATH TIME(trademark(copyright(rights reserved))). i'll see you in a little bit.</p>

        <h2>10:00 pm</h2>

        <p>wew, right on the 10 pm mark too. anyways, any file that was mainly on the c drive (including all the previous windows stuff that the memory didn't tamper with) had to be erased, and i had to use this old finnish windows iso to get it back and running, since reinstalling windows also means reinstalling other things such as the drivers so that things actually <i>work</i> around the clock instead of just being there being broken and not doing anything. to be continued in <a href="19-11-4.html">part 3</a> because i slept oops</p>
