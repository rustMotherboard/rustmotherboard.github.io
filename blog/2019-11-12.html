        <h2>9:18 am</h2>

        <p>hi it's me rust and damn i missed remembrance day! im supposed to be having some form of science class right now but our teacher doesn't appear to be here for some odd enough reason. i don't know why she's off this late, but i have a sneaking suspicion that something rather <i>odd</i> is at the seems.</p>

        <h2>9:30 am</h2>

        <p>oh never mind. anyways today the weekends over and now the school thing is back in session. science test coming up tomorrow and the schedule includes math <i>and</i> french so im not really up to do anything and im actually pretty tired. today i wanted to talk about some objectbloxia stuff once again because i feel today's topic may be rather interesting for the none of you that actually watch drama alert. before we begin, i also wanted to mention that the new <a href="../../../games.html">games</a> page is out, which contains playable embeds of most, if not all of my scratch games! that added a lot of new pages to the website for each game (because if i were to just include every project embed on one page it would take a while to load and would be a bit more laggy, especially for cursor rampage 2 as it uses multiple versions, since there's some versions that act differently than others, which i find to be rather interesting.) one of the versions actually include a <b>boss fight</b> that i still actually haven't beaten after all of this time. kinda disappointing for me if i had to be honest.</p>

        <h2>9:48 am</h2>

        <p>UGH i was just about to get into detail with the objectbloxia stuff but now i almost have to go for life skills (and then math) anyways!!!!!!!! this is not what i envisioned. i'll see you guys in a few hours, then i'll talk about the rather interesting objectbloxia stuff that <i>does</i> get a little feisty. that's all i can say for now. ok byeeEEEEEEEE</p>

        <h2>1:02 pm</h2>

        <p>and im back! so since i already have my work sample project done for career, i have the hour to myself giving me the ability to talk about all that objectbloxia stuff i <i>wanted</i> to tell you earlier. it all began the other dy. i had enough inspiration to go and build a brand new sorta club place. a bit of rundown with these "clubs" that im going on about, they're places that i create or reimport sometimes when i want to place something on the large oven. if you remember from one of my earlier blog posts, the large oven is meant to portray the "worlds largest oven" from bfdi season 4/bfb (battle for bfdi). it's not a perfect model if i had to be honest. not to mention you can't even go on <i>top</i> of the oven anyways. here's one of my earlier screenshots where you can spot the oven.</p>

        <img src="/assets/img/blog/2019/08/RobloxScreenShot20190810_134018893.png" width="1250px" border="4px">

        <p>the oven is this case is that giant cube looking objet behind the 3 tall ladders, meant to reference another BFDI challenge, that being the ladder challenge where you had to climb some ladders, first to the top gets the most points (the challenge introduced points). in objectbloxia people just climb it in order to see who gets to be the team leaders or something, in which then it only goes downhill from there. now, the oven is sometimes a good place for me to place some stuff there so people can check it out. sorta like a slide and match thing. in this case, club ice was the first example to come out of this (first example that i saved as a model). it was a blue club with a screen and a tile minigame on the floor above. what do i mean by this? well, here's how the tile minigame works.</p>

        <p>the tile minigame, or just "tiles" for short is a minigame where everyone is on a disclosed grid of squares of varying amounts and sizes (10x10 or 12x12 for example with 8 or 14 stud sizes). during the game, some squares till turn red for a brief moment and then disappear. the goal is to not fall down when the tiles get deleted and become the last one standing. im pretty sure i was the one to do it the first time, and it kept happening from there because it was always some sort of activity that got the server together to participate. nowadays i don't know what new stuff i can do with it considering the limitations of one person and f3x. my next idea involved some sort of color square thing that works like simon says (go on blue, stay off of red, etc.) i guess you could say that it was pretty colorful. hahahahahah. that was really fucking funny. man, i a just a comedic <b>genius </b> aren't i. anyways enough being distracted, onto the main point.</p>

        <p>so the club was pretty cool for general hangout and roleplays. it had a dance floor, some windows, and a rather fancy design. the tile minigame was also built into itself, meaning i could do some rounds of the tile minigame, or i could do stuff such as soccer if i had the time to manipulate all the tiles and add nets. in this case, this is why i went to make a new, better club. in this case, i was thinking that the newer version would shades of red and black this time in comparison to blue. i still used some blue, but it was for some other, smaller details. oh, and the dance floor. one of the first improvements with the new club was most noticeably the better build quality. the ladder was fancier, there was a set design, and it used a lot more parts, meaning there were more details. another very noticeable change compared to club ice was the brand new roof. instead of it being two giant wedges, it's now an entire new room that uses none other than being longer and wide and open in order to host specific events easier. plus, it's not like it's gonna <i>rain</i> in this game anyways. for one, the game doesn't even have built in weather. for time, we have to manually put in commands like <code>:time 0</code> to make it night and then <code>:time 1500</code> so it can be brought back to daytime. other variations can make it a sunset or to change the directions in which the shadows are facing. however, due to the custom lighting that objectbloxia has, the lights are less powerful compared to the default settings. sooner or later there's going to be the brand new "shadowmap" lighting that'll introduce some new, far different details than how voxel works.</p>

        <p>so yeah it actually took a while for me to get the new club up and running but i think the end result was pretty great! i don't have an image of it right now considering that i'm actually still in career class (and then french), but i can tell you via words that it does look very nice compared to club ice, which also looks very nice. they're both very nice. however, by the time i had the model all finished and exported, <i>one</i> noteworthy person just had to show up. let me tell you the person that goes by the name of <b>master</b>. the dude's a very noteworthy guy. let me explain. he's very controversial amongst the game, being known for harassing staff members, making others uncomfortable, and downright being offensive sometimes like joking about school shootings or emotional manipulation, one of his tactics in order for him to keep spamming about his call of duty lobbies while trying to frame me into getting demoted. he actually made of mmy best friends, pementa, snap about it due to misunderstanding a censored 4 letter word, that being <code>pill</code> in what i assume to censor anything related to drugs, even the common words that go alongside it.</p>

        <p>so yeah that son of a bitch decided to join the server. i tried ignoring him at first but that man just kept going on and on about his intentions to kill furries all over the planet until they're all dead. not to mention the joke about school shootings. the dude kept spamming too which made me kick him several times. due to my moderator status, i wasn't able to ban him which i would only be able to do as an admin. due to master's ungodly amount of alts, he was able to bypass several bans, some of alts impersonating one of the users on the game by the name of <i>maractuslover</i>. after trying to kick master several times until he got tired and gave up, the other mods and some admins started to join in, causing master to do a new tactic that goes directly against me. int his case,he is trying to spam "DEMOD RUST" several times using the fabled copying and pasting in order to make it seem like that I did a bad so that THEY demote me so i wouldn't be able to deal with HIS shit. kinda not cool, dog.</p>

        <h2>1:59 pm</h2>
