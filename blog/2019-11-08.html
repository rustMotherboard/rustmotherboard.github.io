        <h1>im four day weekend o_O</h1>
        <h2>11:00 am</h2>
        <p>guys its me rust but instead im typing on a razer chroma keyboard which makes all these CRAZY clicking noises like mechanical keyboards do but the good news is that the keyboard comes with a audio visualizer so its all good!!!!!!!!!!! so it turns out that i slept all the time during that postpone-age because i was on a discord call and just stalling time until i eventually went to sleep. not the best idea, but at least it works. i have another logitech keyboard somewhere else but i wanna use the razer one more mainly because it has the cool lights that make it actually good for typing in the dark. if you didn't read <a href="2019-11-07.html">the previous blog post</a> you should probably go and do that because today i was going to start off the discussion with what i was going to talk about earlier. <b>uksrt!</b> the rhythm game tournament in which distractions and cool characters are key. like, tell me, im not sure why everyone was wearing tight jumpsuit like stuff in UKSRT9 but i guess thats how the technology world works y man. some interpretations are just wildly different. like man did you see wreck it ralph 2 when ralph goes to the internet and does funny stuff that would've been funny back in 1989. DUDE THAT WOULD BE COOL.</p>

        <p>so yeah i would say stepmania alone is a pretty solid game, i would use it over osu!mania but osu!mania actually has songs that im aware of that aren't old 2000s songs such as patrick sparta remix. modern simfiles made using nITG like to use nothing but mods when people are tryna play maps. like one of these simfiles if supposed to be like megalovania but <b>oh no it's sans time i told you something like this would happened but you lever listened to me man</b>. sometimes this makes it so that im totally unable to play some simfiles the way that they were intended to be played. i know that it's for the whole sight reading and fun thing but sometimes people just wanna play the damn game like it was supposed to be like originally without all thi fancy lore and plot stuff while trying to comprehend what's going on on screen. for example, i was able to play stuff like imperfect cherry blossom 2006 or whatever that song was called on etterna, the keyboard-intended client for ITG/SM5 but it appears that some maps are just a clusterfuck of fast notes that are very hard to do perfectly or at least good because they do all this <i>weird manuever shit</i> that no one can process besides people who have been practicing the damn map for at least one eighth of their entire lifespan.</p>

        <p>lets talk about controller schemes now! if you ever knew about osu then you probably know what one of those tablets are that you see in those CRAZY gameplay videos like DAMN do some people know how to be <code>sleek</code> and <code>precise</code>. i cant stress enough how good some of the people on osu are sometimes. they spend years of their life trying to perfect their movements and reaction time just so they can get number uno on the leaderboard, which would be a <b>rather massive bragging right if i had to be honest on that one</b>! id imagine the conversation being like "dude check this out i got the top rank on osu" and everyone just drops literally everything to check out that ultra cool stuff that you just pulled on them. like that's something everyone wants to be right, and <i>you are the person who they want to be</i>. you are like their GOD or something.</p>

        <p>then again the osu community is always full of crazy drama shit every other day so to be honest if something detrimental were to happen nowadays i think it would cause a much larger twitter outrage than it really has any rights to be. for example, lets assume that one of the top people on osu decide to leave right? some people would obviously not bother with it but <i>some</i>people would take it as some ultra sad thing and decide to be ultimately very annoying about the situation which causes <i>more</i> people to come out and tell <i>THOSE PEOPLES</i> that they're acting like dicks despite the fact that they're telling them that in a dickish manner, and all of this stuff just explodes on twitter and now you have successfully exploded 12 states by leaving a game made for clicking on circles or some other stuff if you wanna try stuff that already has other, better engines. if i had to choose beside osu!Mania or etterna/sm5 i would personally just stick with etterna and try to hit arrows instead of rectangles. i guess thats why os/peppy never made a slogan for those ones unlike classic, because "tap the rectangles" doesn't seem as fun sounding as "click the circles" if i had to be honest. really tapping on rectangles would sound pretty damn boring at first actually.</p>

        <p>wait we were talking about the control scheme of controllers? oh yeah that. actually talking about controllers is kinda hard when the only ones i've ever used were a keyboard, trackpad, and very cheap drawing tablet that only works when you put the pen top down because for some reason it doesn't work when you tilt it in a moderate angle which is kinda crappy design because <b>that's how PENCILS work!!!!!!!!!!!</b> like hell at this rate we might just call THIS acceptable osu controller schemes.</p>

        <p>i mean look at THIS, this is just a crime against nature. a keyboard is supposed to have keys! without it, it's just a mere board! i see many issues with this! i could get for people with disabilities to use this because of all those weird shaped keyboards but this is sorta just.. <code>crossing a line</code>. i dunno man this just sorta bothers me. it has <b>too much power</b> and must be disposed of at once.</p>

        <h2>12:10 pm</h2>

        <p>and here are, the first half of the day has been successfully been taken care of. i think for now that's enough of me trying to TALK about rhythm games, maybe i should try to actually play some maps. i mean, i didn't download etterna with a side of touhou for nothing. not sure how i'll be able to record my scores but besides visualizing it myself the only other thing i could technically do is just screenshot the scores i get. i guess i'll do that. note that <b>i am still using a damn razer keyboard</b> meaning the keys are a bit bulkier. since i use DFJK as my default 4 button rhythm game control scheme, it's gonna take some time to get used to.</p>

        <h2>1:13 pm</h2>
        <p>the results are in and </p>

        <p>i'm actually pretty decent??????????????????</p>

        <h2>4:13 pm</h2>

        <p>so i guess that covers how good i am with the razer keyboard, and how good i am with stepmania maps. i tried getting a different note skin but it keeps resetting to the default one for pretty much no reason. i'm not sure what's causing that to happen, but i think one possible reason could be he difference in intended game versions. yeah, that's probably a valid reason for sure.</p>

        <h2>5:22 pm</h2>

        <p>about what else i should discuss, im not too sure honestly. i never had anything else planned to talk about today, but one thing i could tak about is my next large website idea. my next idea involves a new "games" page featuring some of my old vibeo grames cereal. why so? well, i actually had a lot of old scratch stuff back in the day, and i wanted to give some of them their own proper feature. there's also other stuff such as moving some stuff onto it's own page such as the discord embed,, not to mention art showcase. maybe some sorta... "other" or "extra" page where i can put the rest of it? that could possibly work! one of the main games that i would put on the page would for <i>sure</i> be the short-lived series "cursor rampage". the premise of the game is that you are a cursor and that you have to run into stuff to punch them away. the game was pretty barbaric and bare-boned, though. there wasn't much to do besides collect specific things to grow in size for a short amount of time. another fluke on the first game is that you couldn't technically "die" in the game, making it just an endurance test in terms of getting the highest score. this means you could just leave the mouse on screen while you rack up points gradually.</p>

        <p>for now, while i work on the upcoming GAMES page, please enjoy this little embed of the original project of cursor rampage. warning, the game's actually not that good!!</p>

        <p class="boxed"><b>UPDATE 8/1/2021</b><br>this game is now available at the games page, listed <a href="/misc/games/cursorrampage.html">here</a></p>

        <h2>8:42 pm</h2>

        <p>this is the part where i end the blog post, actually! im out of topics to talk about for the day and i wanna go work on a new part of the site, so byeee</p>
