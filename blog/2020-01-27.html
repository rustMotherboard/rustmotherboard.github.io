<h2>8:58 am</h2>
<p>hi i'm rust and fuck it's monday!!! yesterday i finished up my previous blog post and i started working on my brand new big part of the site. however, the current status of the new page is unfinished and does not have all the details yet. it's the brand new <a href="../../../misc.html">more page</a>! there, you can download cool things like wallpapers and old little tidbits, look at my portfolio, and download the assets that i use for a lot of my things. im not sure what else i'll add to the page after that but i'm sure i'll figure something out! anyways as of right now i'm at career class again with french up next, which is a good group project in the works! i'd say my day's going to be rather enjoyable. however, i won't be able to work much on the more page because the graphics and files are on my home laptop. the other files i could gather would be all of my profile pictures (since i had a version of them backed up on my school google drive) or offline versions of all my scratch projects, and if they're add yourselves or stories, the latest remix tree would be provided. however, you should also be aware that there are also over <b>five hundred projects</b> that i would have to manually download by going inside of it and pressing the download button on each. single. one. they never fixed this during the scratch 3.0 merge as they never made tools that export all of your backpack or projects. no, see, they just told you how to bloody do it ONE BY ONE. like, god, they couldn't bother making specific tools? not cool!</p>
<p class="boxed">bfdi bingewatch progress, episode 19 ( yeah i left off from 17 but i forgot to tell you B) ), leafy and ice cube fall off a really big cliff edge on unicycles because they thought bubbles could backstab. haha dumbasses</p>
<p>nah but seriously the current stuff is stuff i've already told you about now. not really a use in talking about it if it's been mentioned to several times. speaking of which i should try and bloody stop wasting my damn time watching objects fail at unicycles and rather actually send those questions from the interview project. only people who pay attention to previous events will get this reference. i'll close off the post for now and get to bloody work</p>
<h2>11:06 am</h2>
<p>welcome back! i have three cdli classes today (one being... science. ugh.) and we're currently on social studies. since i don't have anything else to do, i'll start downloading all my scratch projects... cause i can! that's one other idea i have for the downloadables, maybe under some "watchables" category? not sure. videos are probably too big. if the files do get too big, one idea i have is to make a drive link, or several .zip files. i have 573 or so projects to download, wish me luck.</p>
<p class="boxed">bfdi bingewatch progress: episode 20... they in <span style="font-size: larger;">SPACE</span> now. space? SPACE? SPAAAAAAAAAAA<span style="font-size: smaller;">AAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaace!</span><br>scratchxt archive progress: just started what else did you think dunkass</p>
<h2>11:38 am</h2>
<p>yeah i'm... i'm still working on it! the fact im still not done with page one is saying something.</p>
<p class="boxed">bfdi bingewatch progress: episode 21... we're nearing the end! four episode to go! woo!</p>
<h2>11:50 am</h2>
<p>THANK GOD. i finally got 1/10th of the projects added to the archive. the bingewatch for season 1 is also almost done. i'm only, like, what? 50 projects in? i need to do this ten more times, remember that. look, i don't wanna risk these projects going away to the tides of time anytime longer. they're all relics of the past! and about.. uh, social studies. we're learning about vikings. bingewatch is at episode 23 of 25. this is where the announcer comes back after firey and flower use their replacement boxes. this is also the episode where we see the best character for the first and last time. that being the CHEESE ORB!!!!! CHEESE ORB FUCK YEAH!!!! anyways it's nearing 12:05 pm so yeah time for me to head out... plus i need the time to get these files uploaded. k bye</p>
<h1>28th</h1>
<h2>2:12 pm</h2>
<p>well i finally got some portion of the archive done while i outsource the rest of it in hopes of it getting done maybe sometime later this week. least the site isn't like an entire GB larger now! thanks to the whole google drive thing, i've been able to get a lot of that data outsourced to somewhere else. only recently have i realized that the hard limit for github repositories is 100 GB. however, most of the data usage actually comes from the images i use. anyways, i'm back for the rest of the afternoon!</p>
<p>anyways yeah besides learning about pull requests and different branches, i haven't really figured out what to do today. rather i think this post's entire point was just more of an update on the new page of the site for downloading things that are old. i'm just learning about different systems of social structure in socials studies (appropriately) while also watching cgp grey. after this, i'll be continuing work with a poster i'm making for the younger grades during french class. it's for a winter carnival! if i'm correct, it's also the 49th annual occurrence of it. i actually had a decent amount of progress done, i just need to add in the schedule and then i'll be good to go! this also explains why i haven't said anything about it being near 3 pm yet, since really it ends at 4 pm (that's when we actually <i>have</i> to leave the building, although sometimes on rare occurrences or events does this rule change. additionally, i also forgot that i bought puyo puyo tetris, which opens up an entire other can of worms for a blog post, which i'll make for the next one. rather, this post just tells you about what i've been doing, nothing much. the last few posts have been these much larger posts that sometimes takes up a week, but i want to start toning them back down again, or make them less broad. broad topics was what lead to that week long post anyways! i'd take this time to continue talking about the poster, but i believe stuff like that is best kept personal for now. besides that, i think this post was more of a mere update! check out the new misc page, i'll add stuff to it every now and again, but the main attractions are gonna be the blog and good ol' portfolio.</p>
<h2>3:14 pm</h2>
<p>additionally, i just took an extra ten minutes watching some guy totally revamp an absolutely busted lock, which i thought was interesting. it's always nice looking at something that was completely broken at first glance, only to be reconstructed back into it's former glory only later. i guess you could call it the video of the post, despite that being an irregular thing. anyways, bye for now! see you at the next post where i talk about puyo puyo and probably go off course onto a visual novel!</p>
