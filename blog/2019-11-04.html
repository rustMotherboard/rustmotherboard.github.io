        <p>man this is just becoming tradition isn't it. i'll try to clue things up in this one. alright yeah so we last left off on when i had the finnish iso on the old laptop of windows. the plan is to download the iso and put it into the usb from the old laptop so it boots into a new copy of windows. the only downside of this would be that everything's in a language that i don't understand. thankfully i used google translate to get through a few steps and poke helped me with a bit of the other steps too. who knew some words could be wildly different!</p>

        <p>the installer was mostly a painless installation, but i had to do the downloading twice since using rufus on the first attempt didn't work. the second attempt however did work and it was right under the USB's limit, which is good. i went through the installer and i could <i>finally</i> run windows again. there was only one problem, though... i never found any drivers!!! well, the installation never came with any of the drivers that i wanted because the iso is for all laptops and not specific manufacturers!! poke suggested that i go to my old laptop <b>AGAIN</b> in order to get the drivers from acer in intel, the most important ones being the internet and optane memory driver. the optane memory driver from intel was te one driver that i thought changing to originally was a bad idea. turns out i was right.</p>

        <p>that process was also.. mostly harmless, but it took a lot of usb shenanigans to carry driver installers on over from point a to point b. once i had the internet running, i think i just went full speed on there to get all my stuff back. in the end, it all worked out. what's the lesson that we learned for the past 3 days, my windows and mac dudes? ubuntu is very mean towards me and i never want to attempt installing it ever again. microsoft ftw</p>

        <p>i actually want to end this post now and move onto something else so forgive me if this is one of the shortest blog posts ever, but i just wanna talk about something else rather than my windows troubles and i have more stories to tell that would work better in a different title. i'll see you in the.. next.. post?</p>
