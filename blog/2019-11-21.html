    <h1>the new generation of strong bad 1 - poopy 386</h1>

    <h2>1:17 pm</h2>

    <p>hi it's me rust and i apologize for not having a plog bost for the last few days. the issue was mostly me having to do a lot of work for cdli in a short amount of time that drained enough time and effort out of me to the point where i just decided not to write a blog post for the last few days. today i'll just be more laid back with it, sorta like the r/showerthoughts subreddit. we'll start with the topic of homestar runner. homestar runner is that one webshow that pretty much caused the idea itself to become a staple of internet culture. it's one of the few webshows that actually appeared in cable tv due to just how popular it is. if you noticed that im using the present tense, that's because homestar runner is actually still chugging along, but a bit.. <i>slower</i> than it once was. i might as well just say "all types of drat" and call myself the new strong bad because of how i just write blogs. the difference is that i don't actually answer my emails unless they're like. one of those <i>verification</i> emails. it's one of my preferred choices on verifying accounts on websites when you sign up for them. don't get me started on some of the services that i sue where i have no other choice but to use my own PHONE NUMBER to answer them. that's why i was never able to verify my google account back in 2015 when i was just starting my own youtube channel.</p>

    <p>on the topic of strong bad, another part of my hour long break is just me watching a bunch of homestar runner videos until the constantly changing bell rings and i go to french class, the last subject for the day. the whole strong bad shtick got popular ever since the guy started answering emails, and now with 120 or so under his belt, it's only a matter of forever before i even get close tlo that amount of blog posts. the dude's jus got about everything going on in his life and he's even a commercial success ever since his new board game of that, flying dragon with the <i>beefy arm</i> came out a few months ago. i never actually bought the game, but i'm pretty sure there might be a version of it on that tabletop simulator game that i could play with.. no one. i don't think <i>any</i> of my friends actually own that game on steam. y'know, that actually reminds me about a pretty cool event that happened last year that i could talk about once i'm done with all the homestar runner stuff. strong bad answers his emails in his own style that sometimes includes some cutaway gags or scenes depicting the stuff that he's talking about on the lappy, one of his series of computers that are all yellowed and old. they're always this power-expensive broken garbage that he just finds laying around in the dumpster like his love life.</p>

    <p>im pretty sure one installment of his email series involved his compy 386 (one of his older machines) getting a virus and breaking the entire world until someone else with a broken .jpeg for a mouth shotguns the computer in the screen leaving our masked man strong bad to go hunt down another computer. i'd think he would have some sort of other hobby, but the other other ones i could think of that would make sense would be punching strong sad in the face with a strong mad for hours on end until strong sad.. uh.. explodes? into a bunch of candy? what else do you expect me to say that would remotely connect to the homestar runner universe? i never even had the telltales game of the show on the <i>wii</i> about strong bad answering emails and walking around. pretty sure one of them involved a fake rock band. although, now i'm just getting off track with my pacing of subjects. that's just how things happen for me constantly.</p>

    <h2>1:56 pm</h2>

    <p>i'd go and talk about my times to tabletop simulator (which includes a card game, but that's all you get to hear before i really go in depth about it) but the time's cutting close to 2:00 pm so i'll have to leave it there for the next hour until i get back home, that of which i'll forget about it for the next 4 hours and have to split the post into two parts. all types of <b>DRAT</b> i say!</p>
