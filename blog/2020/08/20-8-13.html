<h1>Rust_ Episode 25: Return of the Grammar (ft. Baritone)</h1>
<h2>1:31 AM</h2>
<p class="footnote"><b>NOTE:</b> Grammar returns in this post. Who would've known?</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Rust. Been a while since the last post. I was working on some <i>behind-the-hood</i> stuff, most notably the new header, which I've announced before in the previous news ticker below the menu buttons. As the time of me writing this, It's 1:32 AM and I'm bored as hell. With the semi-recent introduction of, you know, <i>that</i> virus, it's a no-brainer I've had plenty of free time to do whatever. Legend has it that boredom is what can sometimes spawn the <a href="../../full/rikotsuraforpuyopuyotetris2official.html">craziest of posts</a>.</p>
<p>Besides that, I've generally just been messing about, doing stuff unrelated to this website. For example, I've recently gotten back into Tumblr, with my new blog available <a href="https://rustmotherboard.tumblr.com/">here</a>. This obviously isn't going to rule out new website updates.. I mean, <i>this page exists</i>. That does remind me, I should get around to properly adding stuff to my portfolio. It's looking a bit "still not implemented" at the moment, and I should look into that. Website shit besides, figured I'd go on about another story (for lack of a better term) for tonight. For the past year, I don't exactly remember if I've talked about this before, but I've been on a Minecraft server for a good while now. The server's called <b>Pandamium</b> (address <code>pandamium.eu</code>), which is a semi-vanilla server mainly focused on the Survival mode. Thankfully, unlike <i>some</i> servers, it's not using any pay-to-win methods. Hell, the only donator-only perks you're really getting are faster cooldowns, more <code>/home</code> and <code>/rp</code> claims (more chunks included). That and cosmetic stuff, like putting a banner on your head.</p>
<p class="footnote">I had first thought that the whole banner head thing was already a feature in vanilla Minecraft, but nope! Turned out to be a server plugin, much like the ability to sit on stairs. Didn't even know that was a feature until the time I accidentally right clicked on some stone slabs. More you know, I guess.</p>
<h2>2:34 AM</h2>
<p>The server also acts kinda like Hermitcraft, with the inclusion of a shopping district. You can use diamonds (or other items) to purchase items like blocks and valuables. You'd think the economy would be fine, but simply voting for the server on it's three to four server listings allows you to redeem those votes for diamonds. In that case, the economy is not very good, as you can easily get 4 diamonds a day, or even MORE if you have an alternate account on hand. You don't even <i>HAVE</i> to be on the server in order for your votes to count! The damn thing knows either way. Eventually, you'll have diamonds <b>up the ass</b> and maybe a new rank to go alongside it. Ranks also help with <code>/tpa</code> and <code>/home</code> timers, alongside giving you more chunk claims.</p>
<p class="footnote">The <code>/rp</code> command actually stands for <b>RedProtect</b>, yet another server plugin that lets you secure your builds from getting tampered with by unwanted visitors <small>(more on that later)</small>. You can set flags on what can be interacted with and even what naturally spawns in the area. Said area being created by wrapping the building in a ring of fences and then placing a sign with specific terms:</p>
<ol>
    <li>[rp]</li>
    <li>Name of the claim</li>
    <li>Additional owners</li>
    <li>Also additional owners</li>
</ol>
<p class="footnote">You can add additional players by using commands under <code>/rp</code>, but I don't want to <i>only</i> talk about what you can do in the server, but rather what <i>I did</i> on the server.</p>
<p>I'd get into how it all began, even after I just described how the server works. However, it's running late for me, so I should take some time to rest first before I take the time to tell you all about the experiences with Pandamium. See you in a few hours time!</p>
<h2>11:16 AM</h2>
<p>Right, where was I? The date was September 13th, 2019. Back when 1.14.4 was still the latest release. Me and Sorvete were going through some Minecraft servers to see which one we would make a base on, considering anarchy servers sucked and some servers were under the whole "pay-to-win" shtick. After a bit of searching, we came across a server that said to work just fine. It was vanilla, had <code>/tpa</code>, in-game economy (which is fine for vanilla standards)-ok you know this already it's Pandamium.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [18:39:23]: You are on region Spawn of player(s) Olexorus.
    <br>
    [18:39:23]: &lt;Sr. Mod | Sundroid&gt; Welcome! To get started, read the signs at spawn but don't hesitate to ask any questions! :)

</code></p>
<p>Sorvete joined the server before I did. We mostly use <code>/msg</code> and <code>/r</code> to chat in DM-like fashion, so that no one outside of the group (which was just two people) would eavesdrop our conversation.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>

<h2>1:10 PM</h2>
<p>Much like everyone else starting a new Survival/Hardcore/UHC (maybe) session, it all begins with <i>mining wood</i>. Everyone does it sooner or later. Earlier I directly recall talking to Sorvete about Baritone. Back then, I had just heard about the mod.</p>

<p>After a minute, we set up a small temporary base at the side of a cliff edge. A basic cave and inventory with a handful of double chests. We were going to prepare here and then go farther out when we felt like we had all the gear we needed.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>

<p>We later discussed the plans for what we'll do with the temporary base.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [18:46:29]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] so is this gonna act like a temporary base for now until we move out farther once we gather resources?

    <br>
    [18:46:41]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] alright
    [18:47:09]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] is pem on?
    [18:47:12]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] another thing, we should consider where to make our y11 cave

    [18:48:11]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] did you ask?
    <br>
    [18:48:16]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] yeah they don't have a copy of the game
    <br>
    [18:48:27]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] aw
    <br>
    [18:48:34]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] would be cool if he joined
    <br>
    [18:48:41]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] i would tell them about sites for that and all but like
    <br>
    [18:48:49]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] this isn't a cracked server
    <br>
    [18:49:06]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] i remember being on cracked servers with the username BIGBADAUD999 because madness combat reference
    <br>
    [18:49:10]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] classic times
    <br>
    [18:49:24]: &lt;Guest | Bremidhy&gt; what year?
</code></p>
<p>At that moment, Sorvete had forgot to add the <code>/r</code> to the message and instead typed it into public chat. This happens rarely, but when it does, it can really get anxious...and embarrassing. Despite that, no one really cared about it now that I'm reading through these logs.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [18:49:42]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] that msg wasn't in /msg or /r but uhh
    <br>
    [18:49:50]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] i think it was 2 years ago roughly?
    <br>
    [18:49:57]: &lt;Guest | Bremidhy&gt; wrong message, sorry
    <br>
    [18:50:00]: Locket_oof left the game
    <br>
    [18:50:08]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] oops
    <br>
    [18:50:10]: skyjoy was squished too much
    <br>
    [18:50:14]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] embarassment
    <br>...<br>
    [18:50:22]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] nah happens to me too man
</code></p>
<h2>2:52 PM</h2>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [18:50:57]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] y'know what
    <br>
    [18:51:03]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] i wonder if this server has that one plugin for cutting trees down easier. also, yeah?
    <br>
    [18:51:13]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] i should make a realm server sometime instead
    <br>
    [18:51:20]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] ooh that'd be neat.
    <br>
    [18:51:30]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] idk the prices for realms rn but uhh
    <br>
    [18:51:37]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] we can probably go fine with the cheapest plan
</code></p>
<p>The downside with Realms is that you'll have to pay for the server instead of being freely able to connect to it. The upside is that it's easier(?) to invite friends, as long as they're on a legal copy of the game. I've lately tried out a Realm server on the Bedrock edition of the game with Dulfin, but not much has happened there since.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [18:51:52]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] btw do you want me to get other types of wood or just oak
    <br>
    [18:51:57]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] then you can invite your other friends and stuff
    <br>
    [18:52:07]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] yeah that'd be nice
    <br>
    [18:52:08]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] up to you what types of wood
    <br>
    [18:52:16]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] some friends have bedrock edition only if i'm correct
    <br>...<br>
    [18:52:34]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] this place is temporary, so we won't be here forever
    <br>
    [18:52:39]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] and i see
    <br>
    [18:52:51]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] alright then so let's not focus much on decoration
    <br>
    [18:53:00]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] just focus on getting materials
    <br>
    [18:53:06]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] and food
</code></p>
<p>For a while, we were just doing what Sorvete said! Materials and food. We eventually decided to use baked potatoes as our main food source. While we were doing this, I was getting tired of the public chat drowning out our private messages.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>

</code></p>
<p>Welp, that was a problem.</p>
<p>So it turns out doing <code>/ignore all</code> ignores everyone, obviously. Sorvete did the same was having the same problem. We quickly crafted some signs and tried to figure out how to uningore everyone. The situation was thankfully handled rather smoothly, <i>if I do say so myself</i>.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>

<p>After that mishap, we decide to start mining for ores by making the y11 cave. Again, here's how it looked in the end. There used to be torches on the left side of the walls, but we took it out when we eventually had to move out.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention. The server sometimes <b>restarts</b> in a minute's time in order to keep the server from overflowing. It's used to prolong the quality, I assume. A bit scary.

<p><i>Eventually</i>, we get around to more discussion of moving to the new base. Note that at this point, we never had a set coordinate to go to. The initial plan was to keep travelling until we find a spot that looked good to establish the base. I had a draft of what we were going to do for the top, but I lost the image a while ago. Sorvete may still have it, though.</p>

    <br>
    [20:11:06]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] to preserve on storage space we could also turn some of the ores into blocks

    [20:12:15]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] the same can go for coal
    <br>
    [20:12:36]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] yup
</code></p>
<h2>9:25 PM</h2>
<p>A common thing I like to do when doing inventory management is to take ores and turn them into blocks, which (normally) conserves space and allows way more of an ore. Let's do a bit of math to prove this, shouldn't we?</p>
<p>We have 64 stacks of iron ingots. A <b>stack</b> is worth 64 of an item (some can only stack to 16). This equals that we have <code>64*64 = 4096</code>. This is way too much for an inventory! However, there's a solution to this space problem. You can craft <b>blocks of iron</b> with 9 ingots per block. This means now our total can be <code>4096/9 = 455 + 1 (remainder)</code>. This equals 455 blocks + 1 ingot. Dividing 455 by another 64 equals 7 stacks of iron blocks with 7 iron blocks has a remainder. This means we now only take up 9 slots (8 slots of iron blocks, 1 for ingots. A great improvement compared to taking up 64 slots.</p>

<p>Our portal appeared in an area that seemed to have been tampered by someone else. I don't remember the place (and I can't double check for obvious reasons), but the old base is far closer to spawn, which is already closer when you're in the Nether due to how travelling works. 1m in the Nether is equivalent to that of 8m in the overworld. We come across some interesting stuff in the Nether sooner or later, but that's at the base after this one.</p>

<h1>14th</h1>
<h2>12:21 AM</h2>
<p>The plan here was to make a pillar near the Nether portal and provoke a Zombie Pigman (that's what they were called at the time). That would allow for the farming of gold nuggets, albeit slowly. The optimal strategy is to pillar up two blocks and hit the pigmen with a sword. Rinse and repeat until they stop trying to kill you. I'd try doing this method again, but the new mobs are far harder to deal with using this strategy. Some of the mobs, for example, the Piglins sometimes have crossbows. Similar to that of the drowned zombies when they're in possession of a trident. I swear, their aim is way too fucking precise.</p>

<p>The end result, if I recall, was worth roughly one ingot. Maybe less. After that wreck, we decided the next thing to do in the Nether was to find a fortress.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [20:43:21]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] btw how many gold nuggets did you get

    [20:44:51]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] turn brightness up
</code></p>
<p>Some time later, we come across a suspicious line of ice. And when I mean a line of ice, I mean the ones that are considered highway systems. I don't know why someone would make a highway system if they knew the Nether (at the time) reset every while or so. Either way, looked like someone has a highway right out in the open. Packed or blue ice, not sure. I recall it being packed, although I could be wrong.</p>

</code></p>
<p>In a possibly dangerous idea, we both thought "what if we went to that base if there's a portal there". The plausible downside of that is if someone were to already be there managing their base, or if the staff were omnipotent and could watch our every move and ban us on sight for taking items. At the time, we didn't know if this server was more lax or more restricted. With my experience of at least two anarchy servers <small>that weren't anarchy because they banned minimaps <small>BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW IT FUCKING WORKS</small></small>, our instincts were to take the items that we find, if any of them were of use. For all we know, the portal could lead to absolutely nowhere.</p>

    [21:01:10]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] it looks awesome
    <br>
    [21:01:13]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] fuck yeah
    <br>
    [21:02:06]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] our temp base is 2.5k blocks away from here
    <br>
    [21:02:15]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] woah

    <br>
    [21:02:48]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] ikr
</code></p>
<p>The base was made in an iceberg biome, with packed ice surrounding a castle-like area, also made in ice. The map either showed the spawn or the base, supported by some beams with torches. I located a furnace with 56 coal. Besides though, the base seemed to be pretty emptied out. There was nothing else in the area, maybe a few low tier items like cobblestone or dirt, but nothing that peaked our interest.</p>

<h1>15th</h1>
<h2>12:00 PM</h2>
<p>I don't remember if the food we got there was also either bread or potatoes, but I'll make the guess that it was potatoes, since that was what we used to eat for a good while until we eventually switched to cooked cod. We managed to get a boat as well, allowing us to travel rather quickly on the ice highway. As some of you may or may not know, a boat on ice goes a long way..fastly. Fast, quiclkly, whatever.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [21:04:45]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] we can go fast now
    <br>
    [21:04:57]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] should we get this crop?
    <br>
    [21:05:06]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] i don't see why not
    <br>
    [21:05:30]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] food for days
</code></p>
<p>We were probably, like, on potatoes or steak or some shit. I don't remember, but I can reassure you that it's not that dastardly <i>beetroot</i>. No one likes Beetroot. Back on topic though, we weren't able to find much. Our guess was that someone used to have the base, but later abandonded it and left not much behind.</p>

    [21:11:24]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] i think both maps are where we are
</code></p>
<p>The bits of map didn't come down because something was catching them before they could fall to the floor. The maps were actually on another floor that was barely even a floor. I remember it just being a staircase that goes to the wall that has the map. Of the base.</p>
<h2>2:18 AM</h2>
<p>Sometime after that, we went back to the overworld, either at the temporary base for supplies or we actually started travelling further out. I don't exactly know for sure yet. This conversation's pretty good, though.</p>

<p>Gonna leave it at that for tonight, actually. It's getting pretty late for blog writing. I'll sleep for a few hours and get back up again. While you wait, look at this <i>WataMote</i> picture!</p>

<h2>2:30 PM</h2>
<p>Do pardon, I've been actually adding some new <i>advertisement buttons</i> to the index! Not to worry, they're not the actual banner ads that get stabbed to death by my adblocker. It's actually those 88x31px images that you put on to advertise your friends sites, much to that of the olden internet days. Funnily enough, every site I've put on there so far are hosted by Neocities in one way or another. I'm out here using GitHub and you DINGUSES are still suffering to 1 GB limits?? <b>CRINGE</b>. I'll continue once I think I put enough buttons on there.</p>
<h2>4:54 PM</h2>
<p>Alright, that's enough of messing with banners of the rather exact size of <b>88x31px</b>. I'll do that <i>after</i> I did the update for this post. Because.</p>
<h2>6:29 PM</h2>
<p>Finally, the interesting part. After exploring and taking some coal from the Cirno base (that of which probably publicizing about it wasn't the best idea in case any staff member reads this <small>(but who would which is the question)</small>), we decided it was finally time to move to a new area and head out for a few thousand blocks. Maybe even ten thousand, although I don't even pay attention to the current coordinates nowadays, so there's that.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>

<h2>10:13 PM</h2>
<p>The next few minutes were solely based on preparing resources, so we were more focused on that and less focused on actually talking or discussing plans. Those said plans were probably in DMs that're long gone by now, as I don't have the logs for <i>those</i>. One way or another, <b>time passes</b>.</p>

    <br>
    [21:36:55]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] nice one
</code></p>
<p>Ah, yes. The Book of Doremy. The hit novel that shook Pandamium on the very server plugins that keep it running. The sheer existence of this few page (or one page) wonder was something to behold. I don't remember the text of it, but it was about Doremy and Touhou...and also about klaust_ because <i>WHY NOT AM I RIGHT???</i> Sadly, if you go to the temporary base now, the book appears to have been misplaced, destroyed maybe. Wherever the book is now, I dearly hope it is in good hands. God, if they put a price on it, I swear to <code>humanity's realm</code> that I'm taking that book back either way. Buying it or not. That shit's ours.</p>

<h2>3:21 PM</h2>
<p>Sadly, we had to quickly abandon the horses, as we came across an ocean, yet horses don't support boats, and we didn't have any leashes. To be honest, I have doubts leashes would even work, but I haven't tested that for myself. Wouldn't bother checking to find out, though.</p>

<p>During this, some public drama was going on between two people and a raid. I think it's interesting enough to show on it's own. I'll let the dialogue handle this.</p>

<p>Do pardon for my lack of in-game imagery. I never took any screenshots until the 26th. These logs take place on the 13th. I'll have to explain this next one with my <b>ELITE NARRATIVE SKILLS</b>. <br>After checking out the turtles near the shore of a beach (or snowy beach, can't remember), we come across a rather peculiar mob grinder. Not a modern design, but rather the old fashioned one, carved out of cobble..or stone. Cobblestone. The model where mobs spawn based on darkness, and fall into trap doors into a singular spot. The grinder appeared to be in semi-working condition. It was night, though. Mobs were spawning around the grinder, which hindered performance to some extent to the point where it was noticeable.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [22:24:15]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] woah
    <br>
    [22:24:24]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] raid time

    [22:24:27]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] i think we just encoutered a grinder
    <br>
    [22:25:10]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] yep, this is a mob grinder
    <br>
    [22:25:46]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] all that's here though is a bow
    <br>
    [22:26:09]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] i used it to increase the durability of my current bow
    <br>
    [22:26:10]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] i wonder if we will ever actually find a populated place
    <br>
    [22:26:16]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] prob not
</code></p>
<p>We did find a boat at the grinder, though. That's yet another boat that hasn't been unloaded by the server for doing nothing significant at all. Eventually, we got to 6k blocks out. In the opposite direction. Our initial plans were to go north, which is -X according to XYZ coordinates. +X is south, in that case. I think. I don't remember clearly.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [22:29:41]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] we're at -6k out

    [22:29:54]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] i think we're going backwards
    <br>
    [22:30:01]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] eh, it's still 6k out
    <br>
    [22:30:16]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] plus it's north according to my minimap
</code></p>
<p><small>(MINIMAP GANG 4 LYFE!!!!)</small></p>
<p>After realizing coordinates, we came across yet another place not too far away from the mob grinder. At first, we thought it was a normal, auto-generated village. Despite our guess, this actually came out to be a roleplay village with custom made buildings, and, if I'm correct, a board that states rules. Much like everything else we've gone through as of the adventure, it was a ghost town with no one but ourselves near the seemingly empty places. Kind of creeps you out, you know? There used to be people working on this, but they left. It gets you thinking on whatever happened. This did not cross my mind however, as I was more concerned on the fact that this is a roleplay village. For a bonus, if that argument from earlier wasn't enough, a bot also joined the server and spammed a server IP to a probably now defunct anarchy server.</p>

<p>In a shocking twist of events, it appeared that someone (or a group) fled a bunch of bots to the Pandamium server in the hopes of the server crashing due to an overload of players. However, the bots appeared to have left on their own terms (or they got banned, not sure). This was the only time I remember this happening during my time on the server. There was also a time where SalC1 was rumored to have joined the server, but I never witnessed that myself. For the rest of time, I am to believe <i>that</i> is an urban legend, whether or not if it's true is something we may never know. I wonder how SocialMinecraft.com is doing considering all of this. Probably banned minimaps or some shit. That and someone duped it to death. Some people do that on pay to win servers, it's actually more of a heroic act in that case.</p>
<p class="footnote">FOOTNOTE: Pay to win servers are like those mobile subscriptions on apps. It's like a normal server, but you can instantly gain better perks, unfair advantages, AND enchanted kits if you cough up a couple of bucks. Why bother actually earning the resources when you can just buy a rank so that you can get the ability to fly and have OP armor compared to everyone else who actually has to <i>try</i> to get the items? In this case, exploiting the server with duplicate glitches is the best way to handle them. If they won't go by the terms of service with Mojang (aka "no u cant just sell ingame items for real money it's not allowed u cant do that"), you might as well take matter into your own hands and <b>bash them into the fucking ground like the <i>runts</i> that they are.</b></p>

<p>I should probably go sleep now. What will happen to the duo after they survived the bot attack, an argument they weren't involved in, and witnessing a fucking GHOST TOWN?? Find out when I wake up in a few hours time! About the ghost town, actually...</p>

<h2>1:30 PM</h2>
<p>When You JOIN &quot;SocialMinecraft com&quot; NOW! Epic Style. Anyways, we're back! Last time, we ended up in a roleplay village. We also found an unrelated skeleton horse. I'm pretty sure those only spawn with a skeleton, so the skeleton might have burnt from the daylight.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>

    <br>
    [22:36:26]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] a skeleton horse
</code></p>
<p>I later found some skeleton horses at the new base we eventually built, but they all fucked off in a matter of months.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>

</code></p>
<p>Do let me remind you that we're 6 to 7k blocks away from base, but we're moving away from it, so does it technically count? Probably. You know, until we come across an ocean. I eventually tame the horse, thankfully.</p>

    [22:39:01]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] he just dissapated
</code></p>
<p>Some time later (aka like 40 bloody seconds), we actually came across an area that was protected with RedProtect, something we haven't seen before. The region was called "Mendilson", owned by <b>lavabubba</b> and <b>raindeeryt</b>. By the sound of the last name, a YouTuber with 12 or less subscribers seemed to have constructed this place with one of their friends. I don't have any screenshots of this either, and I'm also starting to think that the logs here are getting repetitive, <i>especially</i> when SocialMinecraft.com decided to take a visit to the server.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [22:39:23]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] looks like this is an actual place
</code></p>
<p>A relog later considering I was worried about the skeleton horse, and it turned out that the server hid the horse from me and I had to relog in order for it to reload properly so I could interact with it. In short, "horse go missing because server fucked up". Mandilson appeared to be a <i>generated</i> village with some additional stuff added around with all the (good) resources gutted out.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [22:42:22]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] seems like this village might've already been used
</code></p>
<p>Then, my music player decided "hmm today i will put on some fast paced music", which really drove me off the wall since I was wanting to travel fast. Note we do not have elytras yet, so we have to go on foot. Coincidentally, we also appeared to come across a frozen river. <b>AND</b>, if you remember, boats on ice like to go fast because of the physics engine.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>

<p>Needless to say, this was a driving force behind the eventual highways I tried building in the overworld (since the server kept resetting the Nether).</p>

<h2>2:05 PM</h2>
<p>Time, uh, passes.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [22:50:54]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] 8.2k out btw
</code></p>
<p>We were crossing an ocean, and came across a warm ocean biome. Warm ocean biomes are known to be able to generate coral. Luckily for us, we were able to witness some very cool coral.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [22:51:41]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] ooh. coral
    <br>
    [22:52:07]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] yeah
    <br>
    [22:52:41]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] 9k out
    <br>
    [22:52:44]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] are you using shaders?
    <br>
    [22:52:51]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] not right now
    <br>
    [22:52:58]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] not sure if it even works with fabric
    <br>
    [22:53:26]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] the shader that Vinny uses makes corals look gorgeous
    <br>
    [22:53:32]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] o
    <br>
    [22:53:46]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] i think he might be using an earlier version of mc w/forge and optifine
    <br>
    [22:54:11]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] because you need optifine as a forge mod in order for it to work. i think
    <br>
    [22:55:29]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] this is it, 10k
    <br>
    [22:57:10]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] this is west
</code></p>
<p>I do get around to using shaders, but that's also the same time where I start actually taking screenshots. We're still a few days away from that.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [23:00:03]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] brb gonna put on a lofi playlist
    <br>
    [23:00:09]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] alright
    <br>
    [23:00:22]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] alright
    <br>
    [23:01:14]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] we've been travelling for almost an hour now i think
    <br>
    [23:01:25]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] but hey that's fun
    <br>
    [23:01:39]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] yup
    <br>
    [23:01:43]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] we saw some cool stuff
    <br>
    [23:02:27]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] we should use the beds after this btw. i think the phantom timer's gonna hit us tonight
    <br>
    [23:02:36]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] alright
</code></p>
<p>As if the coral weren't enough, we also came across an ocean monument. I have some beef to pick with those.</p>
<table>
    <th>
        <td width="50%">
            <p>Alright, so guardians are these large fish looking things that wander around the monument. You know what I hate about them? Just, them. Their attacks. For one, they charge up this laser and deal some medium damage. While this is fine on it's own, imagine multiplying that by twelve times. The lasers are hard to pick out when there's so fucking many of them to the point where your screen is ONLY the lasers. I can't even see where I'm going sometimes because I'm trying to kill an Elder Guardian before I have to get another 3 minutes of mining fatigue. The Elder Guardian gets a special <i>"fuck you"</i> from me personally. It's the same mob as the regular guardian, although NOW they can jumpscare you and give you a fuck ton of mining fatigue. You better hope to the dream lands that you have a bucket of milk on you in order to get rid of the status effects or things won't be out in your favor for far long than they should be. Once you get a hold of them, they're great EXP and food resources. Especially if you transformed the monument into a farm. Thankfully, RedProtect allows you to disable spawning hostile mobs, which we didn't realize until we had already done a good bulk of the job clearing it out to begin with. Getting the Elder Guardians killed <i>alone</i> killed me and InfinitySnapz (sorvete wasn't on for a while at the time so i invited infinity over) way too many times for me to be proud of.</p>

<p>I say that's enough beef for this upd9. After somehow crossing the monument unharmed, it only took a minute or three until we came across a shipwreck. If we're lucky, we could get some decent items in those. </p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [23:14:05]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] let's check the ship

    [23:15:06]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] there's some iron and emeralds in there

<p>Wasn't the best shipwreck, but it definitely wasn't the worst thing I've witnessed with the loottable. Alright, passes time.</p>

</code></p>
<p>I honestly can't figure out the context of the rest of this, but I assume Sorvete travelled much farther than I did and my minimap radar lost detection of him. I had to <code>/tpa</code> over there.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>

    [23:37:55]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] ok

<p>A bit of silent travelling for a few minutes later with little to no public interferrence or anything interesting, we come across a good spot that we thought might, just <i>might</i> be good for establishing base.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>
    [23:43:42]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] i think here is a good spot to start a base

    <br>
    [23:44:11]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] unless you wanna search for a specifit biome or something

    [23:44:24]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] hmm

    [23:44:53]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] specific biome could be mesa or extreme stone hills
    <br>
    [23:45:17]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] we could build in the mountain and have the front be the balcony

    [23:45:36]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] alright then
</code></p>
<p>It didn't take long for us to locate the biome, only took a minute. Surprisingly, we're almost done with the logs now. I'll try and finish up the rest of this.</p>
<p class="boxed"><code>

    [23:46:37]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] alright
    <br>...<br>
    [23:46:54]: [Guest | Bremidhy -> me] let's make this look as cool as possible

    [23:47:02]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] what if
    <br>
    [23:47:09]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] we made it look like the klaust_ buildings

    [23:47:36]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] how about the colors then

    [23:51:29]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] the floor here would be black

    [23:51:43]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] and we'd have a window on say this side

    [23:51:54]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] with a black border
    <br>
    [23:52:06]: [me -> Guest | Bremidhy] and for some wall decroation we'll have that audio visualizer window thing from the comic

<h2>3:08 PM</h2>
<p>...And the log ends there! Hah, I kid. Turns out the log file was <b>SPLIT INTO TWO THE WHOLE TIME</b>! This log only covers the entire day from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59, to which after it hits 24:00:00, that's technically a new day. In that case, the log gets split per day. The rest of this log is much shorter, though. Anyways, we continue talking about the plans for the base until we actually start building.</p>

<p>The rest of the log has no conversations after that. I assume we talked the rest of the plans on Discord and went to sleep. That concludes that session, actually! Took a bit to get there, but I finally pulled through. At least I was more competent to finish one chunk of it. After all, we still have a ways to go.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/img/blog/2020/08/image_7879.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></center>
<p>That does mean I'll have to warrant a part 2 post sometime soon, but I'd rather keep content diverse and not have it be all Minecraft for the next few months. That concludes this post! Part 2 is.. somewhere. I don't know. If I was able to discuss an entire game's plot line, this is <b>nothing</b>.</p>
