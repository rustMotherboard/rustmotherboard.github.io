        <p>hi it's me rust during school hours again! i set up an html template for new posts so i don't have to manually copy and paste in specific details or attempt to use confusing code snippets (again (since those take a while to make)). i'm currently in social studies class learning on how the church went under this whole "downward spiral" sort of thing during what we call the <i>reformation</i>. i hope you don't mind history lessons!</p>

        <p class="boxed">lets all laugh at a church that never learns anything <b>TEE HEE HEE</b>.</p>

        <p>things begin with the catholic church. this dandy ol' church was one of the first churches to be built, and had the most of the power during this time. because of this, they also had special political power to the point where people would <i>never</i> want to be banned or exiled by the church. during this time, people could just be kicked out of the church by not having the same religious beliefs as everyone else. if you're the odd one out, they won't let you in. <b><i>makes sense, right?</i></b> yeah, try to be different during these times. people would rather be dead than to be exiled by the church.</p>

        <p>some people tried standing up against the church ever since people started having rather interesting thoughts about art and reformation, such as going against what the church wanted other people to do. fun fact, the church tried charging people to get rid of their sins, and tried to make it so that <i>everyone</i> is born a sinner since they're descendants of adam and eve, the first two people created by god according to the holy bible. this is getting real <i><b>crazy time guys ruh roh raggy</b></i>. the church tried going against these people with brains by burning them on a stick like the bonfire, sorta like the <a href='2019-11-05.html'>bonfire i attended the other day</a>.</p>

        <p>however, one of these people going against the effects of the church would be none other than <b>martin luther</b>, who was also one of there people that was a part of the reformation. luther was a monk that taught in the university of wittenberg located in saxony, germany. he used to do some studying in the religion of god, including his book called the bible. a bestseller, i would say. luther was influenced by humanism and individualism during the renaissance. his ideas were based off of <b>faith</b>, <b>scripture</b>, and <b>equality</b>. luther saw the bible in a different way than the church, including disbelief in indulgences and new traditions <i>based off of</i> the bible and not <i>directly</i> from the bible. in this case, luther accused of the church of making up their own rules, some of which never even made sense. because of this, luther tried to <i>ask</i> the church to take down any holidays that weren't exactly from the bible, and that holidays <i>have</i> to be directly from the bible.</p>

        <p class="footnote">footnote: an indulgence is a pardon of one's signs that the catholic church sold to it's followers. basically, you were to pay money to the church in order to get rid of the sins that you did. pretty corrupt and horrible idea to be honest. johann tetzel did even more corrupt by now including future sins to the purchase of an indulgence.</p>
        let's also get into the church's hierarchy system, with the pope on top and everyone else coming down on the bottom, all the way to the point where the priests were the only ones allowed to read the bible, in order to manipulate and control people's readings of the bible. luther took this not very well and told the church that "god things everyone is equal, no one is better than one another". luther wanted to make it so that everyone could read the bible sot hey could study it for themselves and put it in their own interpretation of life.

        <p>after <b>none of that</b> worked, luther decided to take the next BIG step and write a pretty large list that we like to call the <code>95 theses</code>. the 95 theses is a list of criticizing points that acted as something called a <i>public stand</i>. this all happened during the year 1517, which was still a rather large while ago. the reason why luther wrote this besides being angry at the church was because he saw that <i>tetzel</i> was taking advantage of the "faithful", including those indulgences that i just wrote a footnote on. look, i'm pretty sure a <i>GOD OF ALL THINGS</i> wouldn't really accept cash to get rid of sins. it's like he's the toll gate guy when you're heading over from canada to the united states, and well a literal god's just over there asking for the passport like he couldn't just zap someone into dust instantly just because he "felt like it".</p>

        <p>the 95 theses became one of the first "viral" pieces around the world, as someone used a rather new machine called a <b>printing press</b> to create multiple copies so that they could spread the 95 theses all around the world. due to this, everyone started looking into the church's practices, putting them in rather bad financial danger. <b>that's not very good, now <i>is it?</i></b>. the church declared luther as an enemy, making the pope excommunicate luther. needless to say, the pope had some little tolerance for people questioning the church. it's like people nowadays who won't accept other's opinions. i'm sure they would be much more "respected" if they were in the 1520s. would've been more interesting.</p>

        <p>moment of silence for our man luther before he left. he was brought to a place called the <code>diet of worms</code> (which has nothing to do with earing worms) in order for him to be forced to apologize. luther was resistant. look at his facts!</p>

        <p class="boxed">"I am bound by the scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not retract anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. I cannot do otherwise, here I stand, may God help me. Amen."</p>

        <p>due to his mad facts, this drove the church off the walls to the point where luther was punished from being <i>avoided</i> to being called out as a <b><i>HERETIC</i></b>! this means that the church <i>legally forced</i> citizens to not give luther any food or shelter, and that any copies of his theses would've been burned. in worry, luther went and hided out in 1522 with the german nobility, while he printed the bible into german.</p>

        <p>because of all of these events, luther's followers became an officially named group called the <b>lutherans</b>, which also caused groups such as the calvinists, anglicans, and a noteworthy one called the <i>protestants</i>, which were groups that actively tried to go against what the church was saying. all of these events were made because luther did not like the actions that the church was doing. luther finally brought an end to the <b>western europe church</b> a few years later, in an ultimate victory. this sparked people to <i>question</i> things, causing a new revolution of thinking. people were no longer in <b>ignorance</b> or <b>fear</b>. the revolution went and revolutionized itself somehow. props to society for that.</p>

        <h2>10:48 am</h2>

        <p>that ends my history lesson for this hour. recess is crawling up and i got life skills up next. i'll see you sometime soon. maybe. i dunno. give me time please.</p>

        <h2>1:17 pm</h2>

        <p>and we're back for an hour! the afternoon's subject is gonna be science (we're getting into <i>chemistry!!</i>) and then i'll be doing some comic work in life skills for an hour before i'm good for the rest of the day. fun fact, i have a look weekend this week, no school on <b>friday</b> and <b>monday next week</b>, making it a 4 day weekend. chemistry is a very important factor of life if i had to be honest. people would die of a cold of all things if it weren't for chemistry. you know, when it was impressive to die at the age of 35 just because someone had a case of the SNIFFLES. yeah, imagine dying to the sniffles. would've been real embarrassing.</p>

        <p>something that bothers me about the textbook that we use comes in the graphic design. something about it just.. bothers me. i don't know. it seems off. sorta like an old 2000s website style with the fancy boxes and text even when it doesn't really require that. unlike <i>nowadays</i> where it's all overly basic and a bunch of simple nonsense. it's like watching interactive paint DRY. anyways, i just got a bombshell with several questions on physical and chemical properties so i'll have to postpone for later. probably until 3. i was hoping i would be able to discuss more on what i was thinking about, but <i>i</i> should focus <i>more</i> on <i>these</i> questions that i have to do.</p>

        <h2>1:50 pm</h2>
        <p>before i go for another long bit, here's a lil' snippet from one of the science questions. <code>beeswax is soft and burns with a bright flame</code>! yeah, that's your fact for the day. have a good one!</p>
