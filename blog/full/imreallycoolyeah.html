hi it's me rust im finally  back from coding everything into html files. to be honest i think that took much longer than i wanted it to take. you know how hard it is to convert markdown into html and get it working under a swift period of time!? like <i>dude</i> i had to go through so many recommits in visual studio code to make it the way it is now. at one point the buttons never even showed up and clicking on buttons caused them to open way more than 1 tab because it's in some <code>weird constant loop shit</code>. imagine if you had to convert all of your web page files into some other format just because you wanted the <b>header</b> to look pretty. can't take it man v_v
<br>
<br>
i mean just look at these amazing incorrect specimen of what i was trying to do

jokes aside i think the new theme i came up with looks very nice, not to mention now i can have it look whichever way i want. if you don't like how the site's not wrapped entirely around your browser then go and <i>zoom in</i> i hear that makes things much easier than having to recode everything and/or dealing with userscripts. some of those could even be malicious anyways i mean what else are you gonna expect

there's a lot of things that happened in-between last blog post and today's blog post. it's been months, but you get the point. fun fact, i actually had to reinstall my entire windows operating system during this time and let me tell you that wasn't fun at all. imagine reinstalling windows because you replaced the memory card in the device manager in hopes of ubuntu noticing that your C:\ drive exists. that's sorta the gitz on what happened that day.
<h2>10:16 am</h2>
to begin this story we should also figure out the context of what i was trying to do previously before all this weird reinstalling stuff went down. it all started a few months ago when i was trying to get ubuntu running on my laptop for the third actual attempt. the issue with my laptop is that for some reason it doesn't like it when ubuntu searches for existing drives, so it blocks access to C:\ while ubuntu is located down in E:\, reserved for the USB slot in the drive.
<h2>12:00 pm</h2>
forgive me for having shorter text throughout this time, i've been trying to get tidytabs running. it's time for me to finally explain the time i had to totally reinstall windows.
<br>
<br>
it all begins when i decided that i should try yet again to install and run ubuntu on my main drive. the issue that happened previously was that the installer could only detect my portable drive that connects via usb into the laptop. that one issue was the sole thing that didn't allow me to even do anything in regards to install ubuntu, so that was it for the day. but THAT NEVER STOPPED <b>ME</b> NOW DID IT. however, that wouldn't be for the better...
<br>
<br>
me and poke were in a discord group dm while poke was doing some stuff with his own ubuntu/linux distro. i'm pretty sure it was arch linux, in which it's notorious for being one of the hardest distros ever to install due to how much shit you have to do in order to even get it in the installer. at least i was able to <i>get</i> to that step in the installer, thankfully.
<br>
<br>
so normally it works when you take the iso file and put it into rufus, a usb flash drive loader. put the iso in the thing and reboot into usb. seems simple enough? most likely not, since it requires <b>SUPER ADVANCED BIOS USAGE</b>. oh my god not the BIOS............. super scary. AH!!! the BIOS is too ADVANCED for me.
<br>
<br>
i told poke about the issue, and one of the suggestions that he gave me was something about the memory drive. the memory drive is a drive in the device manager that controls memory, RAM stuff. not the car company but the digital memory sorta thing. note that this was the first time i dealt with this. poke said for me to give it a go. the expectation is that changing the memory drive would've allowed ubuntu to detect the c:\ drive with new memory stuffs. however, it pretty much never worked the way i intended for it to work. y'wanna know what happened?
<br>

UH OH. YOU'VE ENTERED EPIC BOOT LOOP MODE. OH SNAP. OH GOD OH FU

<h1>part 2 (11/3/2019)</h1>
<h2>5:16 pm</h2>
oops it seems like i overslept while trying to explain something just as i was about to get to the good stuff. that's never a good thing. thankfully i have full idea on what i was trying to talk about earlier, so i'll continue from where we left of. to recap, i was going to talk about the time where i had to reinstall windows entirely because i was trying to install ubuntu with poke on a discord voice chat when i had the idea of changing the memory drive in the device manager in order to detect the c drive, which wasn't being detected.
<br>
<br>
now that you've been recapped to where we last left off,we now go to the more interesting stuff and when things take a turn for the worst!
<br>
<br>
<marquee>UH OH. YOU'VE ENTERED EPIC BOOT LOOP MODE. OH SNAP. OH GOD OH FU</marquee>
<br>
<br>
that's right! windows decided to go into a boot loop. in my opinion, that's probably not how laptops are supposed to work, but that shit's rocket science. my laptop won't boot! this obviously got me freaking out and i tried to tell poke that it didn't work and it also made the situation much worse than i wished it should've.
<h2>6:29 pm</h2>
so yeah my laptop wasn't feeling too good. a boot loop is when a device keeps repeating the state in which it attempts to turn itself on. because of this, i instantly went into very official rust_ panic mode, the one mode that can rise against gay feelings mode. now, this was in one of the two memory modes in bios. the other mode just straight up crashes the laptop until reboot, so i wasn't able to do anything with the current laptop.
<h2>7:07 pm</h2>
some more freaking out later, poke suggested to me that i have to reinstall windows! after failing to boot into the bios several times, i decided to agree with poke and think that it was the only option. now, here was the plan. i was going to get a windows 10 iso, put it into the usb drive that ubuntu's being run on, and then make it a flash drive. seems simple enough? not unless you have only a 2 GB USB and just your normal laptop. i actually thought all hope was lost lol. HOWEVER!!!! thankfully, due to the fact that i switch laptops every now and again, i am now in the possession of something called a spare laptop. what's one of <i>those?</i> well, it's pretty much a laptop that you don't use but still fully works. it's actually before the aspire es17! this was my old gateway laptop. it's somehow bigger than the nitro 5 (the laptop that i currently use) yet runs slower and probably can't even run minecraft. it's truly a real <b>SHAME</b> that it doesn't work. HAHA. HHAHAHAA. UKSRT REFERENCE HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHHAHAHHAHHAHA
<h2>8:11 pm</h2>
the problem with my house is that my family never even bothers to have more than 1 usb stick, let along one that can even hold an <code>.iso</code> file. now, you may be wondering besides if im even sane or not. what's a disc image file, and why can't it work with the usb? the problem with that is in relation to the file sizes and how big the USB can handle things. the <code>iso</code> for windows 10 according to microsoft is more than 2 GB, which my USB stick is unable to handle, which is too bad. because of this, i thought getting any of this working was eventually a lost cause that couldn't be fixed at all. however, poke, the legend, actually found a finnish iso of windows while i was watching jontron on the ubuntu version of firefox, trying to not bore myself to death just waiting for him to reply if he knows any way for me to plausibly fix this situation.
<br>
<br>
let me try and explain how this works. the finnish version of windows is (for some reason) smaller than the original english version of windows 10's <code>.iso</code>. i don't know why it works like that, but that goodness that the finnish were able to figure out how to compress files to the point where they big for mercy. however, that could also either be just because of how the language works or how it didn't come with any of those SUPER SPECIAL OMEGA WOW WOW DRIVERS that are CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT in order to do such AMAZING ACTIONS as connecting to the <b>DAMN</b> internet. this here was the plan. i downloaded the iso from poke onto the old laptop, then i put it into the 2 gb usb when plugged in to the old laptop and turn the usb into a boot drive. plug the usb into the malfunctioning laptop and reboot into it by changing the order of which things boot in the bios.
<br>
<br>
seems complicated enough? get this, even <i>with</i> all the precautions took, the fact that i changed the memory drive from the devices manager caused all my troubleshooting options from windows to stop working. hard resetting from windows fails to work, safe mode doesn't work, going back to windows takes you back into the boot loop of DOOM, and all system restore points get corrupted and don't work. they probably wouldn't have done anything anyways if i had to be honest. because of this, i had fucked windows to the point where reinstalling it entirely was the <i>only</i> option. i am <b>so</b> glad that i own that 4 tb usb drive where i keep all my important files and most of my programs. thank god for that. anywho, it's BATH TIME(trademark(copyright(rights reserved))). i'll see you in a little bit.
<h2>10:00 pm</h2>
wew, right on the 10 pm mark too. anyways, any file that was mainly on the c drive (including all the previous windows stuff that the memory didn't tamper with) had to be erased, and i had to use this old finnish windows iso to get it back and running, since reinstalling windows also means reinstalling other things such as the drivers so that things actually <i>work</i> around the clock instead of just being there being broken and not doing anything. to be continued in <a href="19-11-4.html">part 3</a> because i slept oops

<h1>part 3 (11/4/2019)</h1>
<h2>8:24 am</h2>
man this is just becoming tradition isn't it. i'll try to clue things up in this one. alright yeah so we last left off on when i had the finnish iso on the old laptop of windows. the plan is to download the iso and put it into the usb from the old laptop so it boots into a new copy of windows. the only downside of this would be that everything's in a language that i don't understand. thankfully i used google translate to get through a few steps and poke helped me with a bit of the other steps too. who knew some words could be wildly different!
<br>
<br>
the installer was mostly a painless installation, but i had to do the downloading twice since using rufus on the first attempt didn't work. the second attempt however did work and it was right under the USB's limit, which is good. i went through the installer and i could <i>finally</i> run windows again. there was only one problem, though... i never found any drivers!!! well, the installation never came with any of the drivers that i wanted because the iso is for all laptops and not specific manufacturers!! poke suggested that i go to my old laptop <b>AGAIN</b> in order to get the drivers from acer in intel, the most important ones being the internet and optane memory driver. the optane memory driver from intel was te one driver that i thought changing to originally was a bad idea. turns out i was right.
<br>
<br>
that process was also.. mostly harmless, but it took a lot of usb shenanigans to carry driver installers on over from point a to point b. once i had the internet running, i think i just went full speed on there to get all my stuff back. in the end, it all worked out. what's the lesson that we learned for the past 3 days, my windows and mac dudes? ubuntu is very mean towards me and i never want to attempt installing it ever again. microsoft ftw
<br>
<br>
i actually want to end this post now and move onto something else so forgive me if this is one of the shortest blog posts ever, but i just wanna talk about something else rather than my windows troubles and i have more stories to tell that would work better in a different title. i'll see you in the.. next.. post?
