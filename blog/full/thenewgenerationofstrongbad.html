<h1>the new generation of strong bad</h1>
<h1>part 1 (11/21/2019)</h1>
<h2>1:17 pm</h2>
hi it's me rust and i apologize for not having a plog bost for the last few days. the issue was mostly me having to do a lot of work for cdli in a short amount of time that drained enough time and effort out of me to the point where i just decided not to write a blog post for the last few days. today i'll just be more laid back with it, sorta like the r/showerthoughts subreddit. we'll start with the topic of homestar runner. homestar runner is that one webshow that pretty much caused the idea itself to become a staple of internet culture. it's one of the few webshows that actually appeared in cable tv due to just how popular it is. if you noticed that im using the present tense, that's because homestar runner is actually still chugging along, but a bit.. <i>slower</i> than it once was. i might as well just say "all types of drat" and call myself the new strong bad because of how i just write blogs. the difference is that i don't actually answer my emails unless they're like. one of those <i>verification</i> emails. it's one of my preferred choices on verifying accounts on websites when you sign up for them. don't get me started on some of the services that i sue where i have no other choice but to use my own PHONE NUMBER to answer them. that's why i was never able to verify my google account back in 2015 when i was just starting my own youtube channel.
<br>
<br>
on the topic of strong bad, another part of my hour long break is just me watching a bunch of homestar runner videos until the constantly changing bell rings and i go to french class, the last subject for the day. the whole strong bad shtick got popular ever since the guy started answering emails, and now with 120 or so under his belt, it's only a matter of forever before i even get close tlo that amount of blog posts. the dude's jus got about everything going on in his life and he's even a commercial success ever since his new board game of that, flying dragon with the <i>beefy arm</i> came out a few months ago. i never actually bought the game, but i'm pretty sure there might be a version of it on that tabletop simulator game that i could play with.. no one. i don't think <i>any</i> of my friends actually own that game on steam. y'know, that actually reminds me about a pretty cool event that happened last year that i could talk about once i'm done with all the homestar runner stuff. strong bad answers his emails in his own style that sometimes includes some cutaway gags or scenes depicting the stuff that he's talking about on the lappy, one of his series of computers that are all yellowed and old. they're always this power-expensive broken garbage that he just finds laying around in the dumpster like his love life.
<br>
<br>
im pretty sure one installment of his email series involved his compy 386 (one of his older machines) getting a virus and breaking the entire world until someone else with a broken .jpeg for a mouth shotguns the computer in the screen leaving our masked man strong bad to go hunt down another computer. i'd think he would have some sort of other hobby, but the other other ones i could think of that would make sense would be punching strong sad in the face with a strong mad for hours on end until strong sad.. uh.. explodes? into a bunch of candy? what else do you expect me to say that would remotely connect to the homestar runner universe? i never even had the telltales game of the show on the <i>wii</i> about strong bad answering emails and walking around. pretty sure one of them involved a fake rock band. although, now i'm just getting off track with my pacing of subjects. that's just how things happen for me constantly.
<br>

<h2>1:56 pm</h2>
i'd go and talk about my times to tabletop simulator (which includes a card game, but that's all you get to hear before i really go in depth about it) but the time's cutting close to 2:00 pm so i'll have to leave it there for the next hour until i get back home, that of which i'll forget about it for the next 4 hours and have to split the post into two parts. all types of <b>DRAT</b> i say!
<h1>part 2 (11/25/2019)</h1>
<h2>8:57 am</h2>
hi again! it's me, the guy who sucks at keeping their schedule consistent. i never got any fan mail to answer over the past few days due to me being extremely unpopular but i've always been like that so the feeling just really means nothing at this point. if you somehow read <a href="19-11-21.html">part 1</a> without dying of being horrendously bored, then you would know that i own the classical video game "tabletop simulator", the game where you shove things around on a digital table and try to play card games until some jerkwad decides to flip the table. the whole point of tabletop simulator is to simulate a tabletop environment. didn't see that one coming huh?? it's a damn <b>TABLE</b> what else are you gonna expect?? i remember seeing a video about it by a very obnoxiously loud youtuber from a few years ago when the game still had an older GUI, meaning i think it was still in some sort of.. early access/kickstarter phase at the time? i don't know, but it did mention there used to be a kickstarter. i suppose the project did get successfully funded, but nowadays kickstarter could be like the death sentence of a dream. but hey, if HOMESTAR RUNNER could somehow make a board game with the funding of that site much like how cards against humanity came to life, i'm sure other projects can still make it out of <i>kickstarter <b>hell</b></i>.
<br>
<br>
a while ago, say, a few years ago, i actually had the game pirated to try it out for myself. i liked the concept, but the fact that i was always on my own kinda bored me out of my mind. i also had the steam version of btd5 given the same fate, but unlike tabletop simulator, i never actually bought the game a year later and bought btd6 instead, the more bubbly rounder third dimension version that thankfully also has co-op mode. the whole thing about tabletop simulator besides it's engine and flexibility was actually it's custom features + multiplayer rooms, great for friends. lets go forward around 2 pc resets and 2 years to where i actually had my first prepaid visa! this allowed me to buy stuff that was pirated for me originally. this included a minecraft account and a few steam games, and guess what one of them was? <b>SUPER MEAT BOY HAHAAA u got PRANK'D!!!!!!!!!!!! <i>(oh and tabletop simulator too)</i></b>. now with the power of paying and using currency to obtain goods and services like a person is <i>actually</i> supposed to do, i could actually play multiplayer rooms with people! the first thing that obviously came to mind was setting up an uno room, so i went to the steam workshop, a hub for game mods and stuff, and downloaded a good fresh copy of UNO !!!!! not the poop <i>ubicrap(soft)</i> version, the tabletop simulator version, the obviously superior version.
<br>
<br>
time for our several hour long break again due to school schedules. when i come back, we'll talk about the actual match. a <code>*dies*</code>
<h2>26th</h2>
<h2>11:04 am</h2>
new feature to blog posts now, i'm gonna have them be several day long posts until all the topics i wanted to talk about in the specific post are done with. i can't stand having blog posts be related to the same thing but are split into like, 2 to 3 parts just because im too "lazy" to continue typing about it. quick rundown on what's going on before we continue with the tabletop simulator topic, im currently attending a special presentation as part of our career class and there are like. <b>30</b> other people here im not sure what to even think about this. it's not anxiety or anything it's just like "the hell's going on who are even half of these people" because i don't know half of the peoples even in the house right now.
<br>
<br>
on with tables of the top! after properly purchasing the game and getting reused to the controls again (and after stacking a tower of cards), i decided the first thing i should do is get uno on the steam workshop and host a multiplayer room with it. yeah, uno on tabletop simulator. i think it's better than ubisoft(crap) uno if i had to be honest considering it has all the rules but it's on a game that actually gets update and people <i>like</i> playing. only downside is that it technically <i>doesn't</i> have the special deck cards from rabbits, rayman, and... just dance, but that could easily be resolved manually by just making your own deck of cards or even trying to script it lol. i can't say i know how to script stuff in tabletop simulator because i actually haven't done that sort of thing before. does it use a specific programming language or it's own programming language? we may never know. anyways, once i had everything up and running, i waited for someone to join in ont he tun o party. while i waited, i remembered that there was a tablet item that allowed me to access the internet and websites in-game. i tried getting youtube to run on the thing, but the videos like to keep spitting out html5 errors which didn't let me watch much videos. <i>however</i>, the thing DID like to support flash. i don't know why it likes to do that but it just does!
<br>
<br>
after some time, i put a lo-fi 24/7 stream on (the one shown below) and silently waited for someone to join in. eventually, someone did! this is actually a rather <b>large</b> turn-around in what i was expecting to happen. i expected that literally no one would come and i would before bored enough to not keep the room up and leave myself. we both played a round or so before 2 more people joined in. now remember this, the room can seat up to 8 players, so we already took up 4 of the 8 slots. this was when the game started to get <b>R E A L .</b> the regular deck of uno cards was all we needed in order to have fun, y'know! due to this, this allowed the game to last much longer since there's a higher chance of the tables being turned.

<br>
<br>
there's something i also wanted to mention with the game that we didn't do, the 0 and 7 card rules!
<ul>
    <li><b>0 rule</b>: once played, everyone switches their hand to the next player based on the turn order, which can either be clockwise or counter-clockwise</li>
    <li><b>7 rule</b>: once played, player can choose any other hand from someone else to switch with.</li>
</ul>
back when i used to play the ubisoft uno on both my xbox and then my nintendo switch, the 7 and 0 rules were what made each match (with the cpu players) much longer than they should've been. i'm not sure how these rules were included with the game but they were marked as optional in the game anyways so i guess that's rather interesting to know! the reason why we never did this in the tabletop simulator uno is actually something that i forgot about. i don't remember if it was a regular deck of uno cards that we moved around or it was all scripted meaning some processes were done automatically. now that i think about it, im pretty sure it was a manual deck of uno cards that had no scripting to them. either way, i'm glad we had fun with it back then!
<br>
<br>
some time later, i set up a stopwatch object on the table and thought that we could have the "world's longest uno game", since this was taking a while. we went through several people saying "uno!" yet we always found out a way to give them more cards before they could play their personal exodius on all of us. stuff like this kept the game interesting. as time went on, we only further suspected on who might pull the next trick out of their sleeve.
<h2>12:02 pm</h2>
yeah i know stuff's about to get interesting and i still haven't described the whole vr man thing like in the title, but i have to go now, the morning's almost over! no worries, i <i>do</i> have a CDLI class during the afternoon at 2 PM so i could discuss the even JUICER stuff during that. alright <i>byeeeeeEEEE (AGAIN)</i>
<h2>2:15 pm</h2>
welcome back! today while i go over some study guide stuff, i'll be finally talking about the rather mysterious vr man. get this, tabletop simulator actually has proper support for <b>virtual reality</b>, where you wear a headset and hold two littler things that allow you to move your hands and head ane be able to interact with the game properly. tabletop simulator had support for this, and you could even tell when they were playing in virtual reality or not! im not even <i>sure</i> why people would play a tabletop simulator game in virtual reality, since i'm pretty sure you have to be standing UP for the whole time... so that could get pretty uncomfortable. does it work when you're sitting down? i don't know, not at all. the other reason why i don't know at all is also because i've <i>never really used something like a <b>virtual reality headset</b> before</i>. im  not sure if anyone else that i know have also ever tried one before, or how the experience was. personally i never really found the appeal of some virtual reality games because some could easily be done with just keyboard controls, but i could see the appeal of being immersed in games. like imagine if i were going to go all like "wow i can't wait to go and play uno with my friends" and then you just put on your virtual reality headset and play it in a simulated environment instead. i guess that's how thinks work nowadays haha. now i'm not saying that's a <i>bad</i> thing or anything, rather on how the 180 degree turn in what you'd expect from going to play uno with friends at an <b>actual tabletop</b> to a room in <b>tabletop simulator</b>. both are fine ways to do it considering the distance of your friends to begin with.
<br>
<br>
so then that sorta thing just happens with us. someone in virtual reality actually joins our tabletop simulator game for the world's longest uno, like holy <b>fucking <i>shit</i></b> that's some CRAZY we got. the timer was at like 5 or 15 minutes in by now and the fun just literally peaked my man. people were doodling and talking about how their day's have been and i feel like i was able to bring everyone from different parts of the world together. all types of drat, man! i could've make everyone's day better, and here i <i>was</i> doing that! man the whole thing felt great. i totally forgot who won in the end. then again, i barely remembered anyone's name from that, which was pretty disappointing for myself because i was able to remember all of the other details. in this case, i have no idea what i was doing with my life at that point in time, and i don't think i'll <i>ever</i> know. hell, for one thing, the internet's gonna be down all morning tomorrow, leading me to have... <i>some time for blogs??</i> in this case i have actually no idea considering usually the one time that happened on a weekend it caused a whole SLEW of posts back in the markdown days. if im correct those series of posts were about me doing random things and then blogging about it in eye-bleeding white theme.
<h2>2:57 pm</h2>
to conclude all the tabletop simulator stuff, i feel that that experience was very fun! uno is always a great game to meet others and have fun with. for one, we were even able to get some guy in virtual reality to play uno with the rest of us and we tried our literal best to make it the "world's longest game of uno" in recent history. i'll be honest, we probably never got the record. i forgot the time of it too. either way, thing was fun. time's cutting close again, i'll see you all soon! this also concludes all the topics i wanted to talk about for this blog post, so i say this post itself is also all done and dusted, so i'll move on to the next post after this one! anyways bye now!!!!!!!!!! <code>*dies again ahahaha.*</code>
