        <h2 id="1201am">12:01 AM</h2>

        <p>Thank god for my coding program allowing me to make this shit easier. Anyways, if you haven't read part 1, please read it over <a href="2019-08-07.html">here</a>. Now, back onto what I was going to talk about before I realized it was almost Thursday and not Wednesday. Me and Skaboof were about to watch Starman3 the decade old pedophilia expert's Roblox Goes Crazy series when I remembered, "hey, starman3 isn't cool anymore!". I used to love watching Starman3's content years ago, back when SMG4 wasn't just a GMOD channel that makes that one bootleg RWBY show called Meta Runner. I was going through the 28 episodes trying to find one joke about a slide. This slide used to be an ongoing gag in the later episodes of the series where someone would go "whatever you do, do <strong>not</strong> go on the slide", and then the person rides the slide anyways, thrusting them into orbit with high amounts of speed. They did the joke to death, if I had to be honest. The reason why I'm mentioning this is because the current episode of RWBY House that I'm working on (also mentioned in the last blog post) has the slide joke <em>and</em> Starman3 included in it because I thought it was slightly comedic, and it fits with the plot of the episode (which I won't reveal due to not very epic <em>spoilers</em>).</p>

        <p>It took a while before we found the earliest known example of it, but it did open us to find some other somewhat interesting jokes during the time of me flipping through episode after episode of Windows Movie Maker action. I asked Skaboof if he wanted to see my own version of a Roblox Goes Crazy video, but I never got to show him that before we both left the Watch2gether room. It's a shame we weren't able to get to that, but it was an old video either way, so I'm also glad in a way that we never too the time to actually <em>watch</em> that.</p>

        <h2 id="100am">1:00 AM</h2>

        <p>We've finally hit 2 hours until the spooky 3 AM. This must be the perfect time for me to dabble into that ROBLOX thing I was doing which I briefly mentioned in the previous post maybe!</p>

        <p>Alright, so have you heard of Danganronpa? No? Back then, me neither! I just forgot how to spell it 5 minutes later so I kept referring it to as "Dangananananronaanaronapa" or something along the lines of that.</p>

        <h2 id="234am">2:34 AM</h2>

        <p>Yeah, so it starts out with me joining the ROBLOX place Objectbloxia, as per usual. I'm a moderator on there, so I can pretty much do anything as long as it doesn't destroy the server. Fling someone endlessly for calling someone else a poopy head? Consider it done when I'm around. Danganronpa works as a visual novel sort of game where everyone is in this one school, and one has to kill each other and accuse it on the other in a class trial, where the guilty gets executed. Repeat until 4 or 5 survive and move on to the next game. They like to kill off the good characters because fuck you here's a full house of depression.</p>

        <p>Moment of silence for Chiaki Nanami. Does this count as a spoiler? I dunno, probably.</p>

        <p>Moving away from that, the first thing I did when I got onto the game was to get myself the essential building tools and flying. I head on over to the empty side of the map near that mansion from the second half of Inanimate Insanity 2 and notice there's a school being built. The owner of the game, "However", is also there working on one of the rooms, that being the cafeteria. I had my RWBY House Ruby Rose custom morph and I flew to him and asked on what he's doing. He replied that he's working on a school for a sort of Danganronpa roleplay. I later get the information that he's also a fan of Chiaki Nanami, which is <em>always</em> a good thing. You can never have enough Chia
            ki Nanami. Anyways, Skaboof, Sanic, Rural, and Bowtie (important later) all show up somewhere later, with Skaboof still being in his Robloxian form, and the rest respectively being in their OCs, Zoka, MePod, and well BowTie is also in his Robloxian form like always (much like Skaboof, except more often).</p>

        <p>One of the game admins, Pementa, was also there as well. They had a morph for Pent if I'm correct, which is one of the characters in Khonjin House that are in the ladder half of the series. To be fair, Objectbloxia's staff <em>is</em> a bit large for a ROBLOX roleplay place with usually under fifty players. It's prime player amount is usually in the thirties or whatnot.</p>

        <h2 id="325am">3:25 AM</h2>

        <p>Yeah, so everyone was just hanging out in the open spot of the WIP school. However, fun fact, <strong>we never used that</strong>! Someone thought is was perfectly fine to just import a random school model into the game to replace it, and the one everyone was pouring their time into was just exported with F3X and put on someone's inventory for importing later. While this was going down, Skaboof offered me to take a look at his old ROBLOX recreation, back when studs were circle and stuff before LEGO slapped their greedy cheeks. That was so wrong out of context oh god. The place was mainly consistent of a house and what appeared to be and overgrown lawn. The path was tunned with some invisible walls, presumably so players wouldn't wander off.</p>

        <p>Despite this, we never got to the point where we did the <em>actual</em> roleplay, we just stuck with Danganronpa in a free model. The worst part about the free model was that it had a really scummy script that prompted <em>everyone</em> to buy some off sale t-shirt every literal 2 minutes. Whoever made up that concept should have a piano crushed on them until all that remains is the blood.</p>

        <p>I'm getting ahead of myself, though. Once the free model was imported, Bowtie thought it was perfectly fine to spam graffiti of Godzilla over the school walls, because <strong>GODZILLA OH WOW</strong>. That guy is like, probably the one person I'll ever know that likes Godzilla <em>this</em> much. That guy's just a monster who has a feud with New York for fucks sake. At this rate, he'll have <em>tea</em> with one of the god damn buildings. "However" went and removed most of the graffiti, and left one copy of it on the front wall of the gymnasium. Personally, it should've been removed all together. Anyways, after some doing literally nothing in order to stall time, one of the staff members teleport all of the non-admins to the outside boundaries of the school. However, they don't know what's going to come out of what's going down up in here. That was too contradictory to make even the slightest bit of sense.</p>

        <h2 id="412am">4:12 AM</h2>

        <p>Once everyone gets into the building, the people with building tools customize their lockers to fit their own characters. One of them actually being based off of a recommended character that <em>I</em> sent in myself! The the person who uses that morph, Syeed, uses that character usually, but had the gender wrong (male when should've been female), so Syeed went and made their own male version of the character instead. That character being Juice Box. I feel that I did a good job with the asset, but the drawing style could've been better to be honest. I'm glad I switched over from Animate's Paint Brush tool to it's Pencil tool, as I got used to that instead of dealing with the Paint Brush tool's limitations.</p>

        <p>I'd love to continue discussing this, but right now I wanna sleep. I'll continue writing once I wake up.</p>

        <h2 id="1248pm">12:48 PM</h2>

        <p>I'm awake! I got myself a bottle of Sunny-D and I'm ready to continue discussing the ROBLOX Danganronpa RP going on over in Objectbloxia.</p>

        <p>Anyways, after everyone were done building their lockers (some had to ask others to build the lockers for them as they never had the permissions to use the in-game building tools, which I'll later refer to from now on for the most part as <code>F3X</code>, just to make things easier for myself. As I was saying, once everyone actually finished their locker designs (including myself!), everyone went down over to the gymnasium and started... attempting to swish in some hoops. I'll admit, everyone at least tried their best to get the ball in the hoop. The dang thing didn't even have a net! Well, actually, I don't know why the hoops have a net. It doesn't really do anything besides make it look more like a hoop for something you thrown <em>in</em> and not just throw <em>straight up</em> from right below the hoop.</p>

        <p>I should explain about the ball too. It's barely a ball. I had to actually add in the ball myself using F3X, and even then it was originally too big for me to actually move it into the net for some sense of accomplishment. That ball is a literal <strong>joke</strong>, and should be ashamed of itself for failing at doing it's sole purpose <em>this</em> badly. I dunno what else to say towards that ball besides shame on it. I swear, it's even more disappointing than this.</p>

        <p><a title="This is totally SpongeBob. Shut up."><img src="/assets/img/blog/2019/08/spongebob.png" alt="" /></a></p>

        <p>That aside, there's another thing I should note about the ball. Since we're dealing with ROBLOX here, it's a bit obvious that the physics are a bit fucked for what it is. One notable example of this probably has to be, well, what I experienced myself! Some people like to roll the ball by standing on the edge of it, causing <em>their</em> weight to push the ball and get it rolling at a moderately fast speed. However, if this is done sloppily, there's a chance the ball might freak out and actually send you flying. This actually happened a lot when I mess with physics using F3X.</p>

        <h2 id="116pm">1:16 PM</h2>

        <p>After like one person flew out of the building and back onto Objectbloxia's main land, it was time for none other than the moment you've all wanted to see. A message shows up with the fabled <code>:n</code> command. <code>:n</code> is a command that allows the staff team (moderators and up) to briefly show a message on everyone's screen. For some reason, we use this a <em>lot</em> more than I think we should.</p>

        <p>What do I mean by messages? These are an example of messages. They're essentially commands that moderators can use in order to convey messages. The admin script for this game is different though, and shows these messages a bit differently, with a bigger size, different font, and a blacker color, with a slight <em>blur</em> instead of just a simple cover with a bit of opacity.</p>

        <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/2019/08/d405f31a26d62094dd0f7ec8742a9eec.png" alt="" /></p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>:m</code> fills the entire screen.</li>

            <li><code>:h</code> only takes up the header space, on the top.</li>

            <li><code>:n</code> crops the <code>:m</code> command so that it only takes much less space on the screen, but is less transparent.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This should help you properly understand on what I mean by how the staff team use messaging like this. It's more public than private, but we do know what to keep private, unlike Bowtie. However, I'll get to that eventually in this post.</p>

        <p>Anyways, now that you know how messaging works, back to the roleplay. </p>

        <h2 id="410pm">4:10 PM</h2>

        <p>So yeah, a message was sent by one of the admins in intercom about the <em>fact</em> that everyone was, in <em><strong>fact</strong></em>, <em>trapped</em> inside the school area! Oh no, that isn't very good, now is it? Much to everyone's shock, the rules were as follows. One person would die by someone else every so often, and a <em>class trial</em> of some sorts would begin. This sort of works like a court case, but the guilty person is executed in a unique fashion. Being the funny haha person that I am, I consult the intercom announcer that they're actually that black and white panda teddy lookin' bear from Danganronpa, and I was sadly proven wrong. It was just a Robloxian. I was really sad to hear that, because I hate their design sometimes. You ever saw, like, R-Thots before? They don't have any talent in photography.</p>

        <p>Now, everyone was also shocked by the fact people were going to die too. I also note that "the school walls are most likely going to be covered in a <em>lot</em> of pink blood later on", but the not panda bear man went and gave everyone pink blood. I'm pretty sure at least <em>half</em> of the people there felt violated for that one thing alone. It's just fucking ridiculous. What is this, Legoboynj? I thought <strong>NOT</strong>!</p>

        <p>One of the characters part of the roleplay, Caden, with the character of a magnifying glass, seemed to be the most scared out of everyone, stuttering every second word like they're straight out of DeviantArt. The other character (who is <em>also</em> important later), which I'm pretty sure was named Plastic Katana, also came up near Caden when I was there too. While I was discussing about Caden not having to always be this scared about sometimes the most serious of stuff, I later mention that "people would probably vote me because I'm a weapon". Plastic Katana, despite being plastic, said that he "wouldn't hurt anyone", and that he's "a nice guy". When I mean voting, I mean during the class trial for when people take their vote on who exactly is guilty. It's like murder mystery, but you also use murder to <em>solve</em> your problems <em>of</em> murder.</p>

        <p>After a bit of more discussion on the lockers and being utterly disappointed at that one ball, the announcer bootleg bear man announced that it was cafeteria time, which essentially means recess, which essentially means "eat food time". Now, this is where things actually get interesting. But, like all things, it ain't perfect. This is where... Bowtie comes in.</p>

        <p>I ain't someone to complain about stuff that does seem serious, but Bowtie had just heard about none other than a murder in his area of one of his friends (or, that's what I remember. At least, it was someone in his hometown). Bowtie always likes to, y'know, <em>vent in the wrong place at the wrong time</em>. I understand that it's mildly serious for him since his <strong>life</strong> is on the line, but talking about it on ROBLOX just seems like a really dumb decision. I tried telling Bowtie to take it to the game's Discord Server's serious channel, but <em>no</em>, he just insists on talking about it here like always, which obviously got, like, <strong>half of the server involved</strong>, which usually never ends well.</p>

        <p>Back to the cafeteria session, me and Pent (if you paid attention, you'd know this is the staff member Pementa) got to see Juice Box take advantage of his straw and reveal an abnormally large sandwich for something he would eat. Needless to say, the sandwich fell over before he could take the first bite to begin with. I'd say most of the audience witnessing the tall as fuck sandwich were shocked to see the sandwich at the first place. Some even tried to believe that it was impossible. You can't trust what you see, magic <em>is</em> false, after all. Know your facts!</p>

        <p>Now, time to finally heat things up for once. That's right, the entire point of this roleplay has been fulfilled! One of the characters in the roleplay got murdered in the backroom of the cafeteria! But, who was it? It was none other than the <code>literal ghost</code>, Bow, of course! Y'know, the one ghost object from Inanimate Insanity 2 that's overrated and has some singing problems. I have no idea how the murderer would've been able to stab a ghost with an axe, since Bow could've just phased through it, but another weapon, a bottle of <em>sleeping pills</em> were used to also overdose Bow to what seemed to keep her from moving away from incoming danger.</p>

        <p>Caden, like I expected, has a literal fucking panic attack looking at the unneeded pink blood all over the floor and some on the wall. The weapon in question, the axe, seemed to be in relation to Caden's axe. Why do I mention Caden's axe? Because that character <em>has</em> an axe, poopy head! However, there is a difference in the axe design that doesn't make Caden the murderer. That one detail is the blade of the axe. The murder weapon axe has a basic, shiny white blade, while Caden's is told to be a transgender rights colored blade. This difference makes Caden, well, <em>not the murderer</em>. You can strike him off the list of possible murderers.</p>

        <p>During everyone freaking out about someone dying for a lack of logic, one character (or seven), the Chaos Emeralds were trying to figure out how they'd get their lockers working. Now, obviously enough by what they're even <em>doing</em>, that makes them <em>definitely</em> not the murderer, so they're also crossed off the list. I come up to them and tell them to just use the top column of lockers, as there's enough lockers so that there's one locker per chaos emerald. Each one of them thank me for the idea and decide to literally do nothing with lockers to begin with, because literally no one use the lockers.</p>

        <p>In fact, there isn't even anything to do with education laying around, which is even more stupid because the point of a school in the first place is to provide information and help people learn. This is more of a disguised murder house, if you ask me. Now, there's also another character with somewhat of the same personality of Caden, that person being Glowing Heart, another object character, but this time from the show <em>Open Source Objects</em>. She was all "oh my god" and "oh no" and was pretty much crying all over the floor for the next 3 minutes until the class trial began. Definitely can't be Glowing Heart. Her pure body wouldn't even <em>touch</em> a drop of pink blood.</p>

        <p>This leaves us down to a handful of people. Juice Box, Bowtie, and Plastic Katana. There were a lot of other people included too in the roleplay, but barely any of them are notable, as I never actually talked to them. I could mention another one though. That one being Pementa actually, the one playing as Pent. I told him about the whole pink blood thing, and he was indifferent about it. Some may think he's suspicious, but he didn't do much. Not him.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><s>Caden</s></li>

            <li><s>Glowing Heart</s></li>

            <li>Juice Box</li>

            <li>Bowtie</li>

            <li><s>Pent</s></li>

            <li><s>RWBY House Ruby Rose (me)</s></li>

            <li>Plastic Katana</li>

            <li><s>Chaos Emeralds</s></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The class trial finally begins after a bit of weird waiting. During this time, everyone talks about the murder weapon, which I already discussed. Due to this, I'll skip that part and get straight to the voting, since the rest of the trial was just people blabbering about, like, one or two people.</p>

        <p>The voting was handled differently, as instead of voting, a <em>fingerprint test</em> of all things were used to identify the murderer. The axe itself was scanned to see who held it. Now, it's time for the dramatic waiting to see who gets the boot in the most deadliest way possible. Death!</p>

        <p>The person guilty was............</p>

        <p><strong>PLASTIC KATANA</strong>! I was shocked too, originally. He said he was a nice guy! How could he have killed Bow? Well, actually, I'd like to know <em>how</em> he killed Bow to begin with. The girl's a ghost. You can't kill what's already dead. Despite all of this, Plastic Katana was banished to the Shadow Realm to face his death. What was his death? Ninjas attacking him, of course! A nice sense of irony, but it's deadly nonetheless. Pretty effective, though. He bled to death. We only read the text of the execution, but I'd imagine there being a lot of blood for what it is.</p>

        <p>And... what happens next? Nothing. Yeah, nothing! The host of the game <strong>left</strong>! Everyone just went back to mainland and it was like nothing happened. I guess that ends the story of the Danganronpa roleplay. It was getting mildly interesting until the owner left, causing everything to just break down in an instant.</p>

        <p>To be honest, that was one of the weaker moments of Objectbloxia. I don't have really anything else to say about the game, since I left after the roleplay due to being bored. That leads to where we are now! I haven't done much after the roleplay, and that was yesterday anyways.</p>

        <h2 id="504pm">5:04 PM</h2>

        <p>By the way, if you noticed while I was typing this, the main pages on the site have gotten a makeover! I don't know when I'll have it done, but I'll get at least most of the progress done today. Most notably, the buttons and site layout. There's a new <a href="/projects.html">Projects</a> and <a href="/ifindex.html">Social</a> page, but I'll be taking my time on the Projects page as of right now. Off to work!</p>
