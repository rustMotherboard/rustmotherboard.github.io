# contributing

since most, if not all of the work on this website is done by myself, contributions should be made using forks and pull requests, which should just be for bug fixes.

for example, say i've forgotten a while now to update a specific image, or that there's a typo in something. you can make a pull request with your own (UP TO DATE) fork of it, i'll check it over, and it can be inserted.

additionally, most contributions from others are normally to outsource work so it can be done faster. not for new content entirely!
