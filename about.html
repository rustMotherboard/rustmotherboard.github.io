            <p>this here is my own website, made mostly in visual studio code. it's a static website, so i have to use some backwards workaround shit to do shut like loading in a header and footer. there's some code at the top and bottom of every page that loads them, that and a back button!</p>
            <p>if you're having trouble reading the marquee, my name's rust! i'm a vector artist that lives in the middle of nowhere in a time rift. my main aesthetic is a bit of y2k while retaining a sharp and geometric style. im not really known for anything. i guess that one yu-gi-oh gx post i made that got popular on tumblr could count as one thing. i guess</p>

        <td>puyopunk is the project i've probably done the most active work with. it's a sci-fi post-apocalyptic time-skip take on a puzzle game known as puyo puyo. i've always found puyo puyo's writing, characters, and aesthetics to be poorly constructed and unable to work with that blasted blob puzzle game mechanic. what i did here was take everything you know about puyo puyo and destroy it. utterly crush it to hell and back. i then apply my RUST_ BRANDED ASETHETICS and flip everything upon itself and make things cool...cause! there's no real rhyme or reason past that.</td>

        LITERALLY GENDER ENVY..i also like him a lot. i like the main 4 of hxh a lot. they're all cool and they do cool things and kurapika has the additional bonus of not giving a fuck about gender. some of us i think actually went with a headcanon that kurapika's transgender. that's so cool........so awesome........also this plush is adorable i can cuddle it.whenevr the plushes actually arrive. i was told i'd still be waiting a few weeks for them</p></td>
