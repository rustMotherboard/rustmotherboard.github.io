        <p>i made the site you're currently looking at right now. i work on this on and off every now and again, although sometimes i forget i have one at all.</p>

        <p>prior versions of this website used to be entirely made in markdown, although then i took the time to actually learn about HTML and all that, and i think the results pay off</p>

        <p>the only projects i work on at the moment are mindvisor and achs, but i do like to try different stuff once in a while, and i have a decent track record of trying out a bunch of stuff and then never touching it ever again</p>

        <p>could be a result of adhd but im not sure on that</p>
