<h2>sticky cursors</h2>
<p>a very old cursor pack from a few years ago back during the scratch days. all images were made in the scratch editor and compiled only now into a usable cursor pac. i don't know why you would want to use these at all, but the option's there if you want to.</p>

<h2>marblesquared 1.2 beta</h2>
<table class="borderless" width="100%">
    <td width="75%"><p>marblesquared was a project in regard to algodoo marble races. for those who don't know, algodoo is a 2d physics sandbox, and can be used for a variety of physics-related situations, some of which do include marble races. marblesquared was going to take a more modular approach to the race, allowing different pieces to be connected together.</p>
    <p>there was originally an installer for this that i actually was able to compile myself, but i took that out for this re-release. i don't think the original was ever published though. could be wrong!</p></td>

<h2>scratchxt archive</h2>
<table class="borderless" width="100%">
    <td width="75%"><p>this is one of the larger parts of the downloads page. what you're seeing here is <b>over 2 GB</b> worth of 600+ projects that were made during my time with the kids programming site named <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">scratch</a>. it's a visual-based programming language designed for the purpose of creativity. with a clunky graphic editor and some horrible grammar, the scratchxt collection contains some of my first work in the digital space, including some bonus projects!</p>
    <p>this collection contains three categories, the main projects from the accounts ScratchXT, ScratchXTRises, and ravenGenetrix. the latestremixes folder has the latest remixes of projects (such as ones that encourage adding your OC, have that be remixed, then remix that, etc), and the bonus folder contains misc projects that i thought were funny or some highlights of certain remixes. gifts also fall under this</p>
    <p>(note that you'll need the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/download">scratch offline editor</a> in other to load these projects)</p></td>
