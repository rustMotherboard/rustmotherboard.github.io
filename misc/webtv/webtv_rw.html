        <p>RUSTWORLD is a roblox game i'm working on whenever i'm bored to do anything else at the moment. it's one of those decal roleplay games but all of the areas are based off of friend group inside jokes or past work i've done, including really old roblox models from 2016 and prior</p>

		<p>due to my inefficient optimization skills (and also just really big map in general), it'll take a decent system for it to actually run any good. should work fine on a desktop pc or a high end phone</p>
